","<p><b><span>Fiscal Impact through Fiscal Year 2017</span></b><span> Initiative 1185 is estimated to decrease state transportation revenues and expenditures from requiring new legislative approval to impose tolls on state highways and bridges. The total fiscal impact is indeterminate, but state toll revenue and transportation expenditures are estimated to decrease $22,800,000 to $33,100,000 in fiscal year 2017. Requiring new legislative approval to impose fees will also prevent implementation of certain businesses and health care certifications, which is estimated to decrease state revenue by $2,713,000 and decrease state costs by $3,611,000 over five fiscal years.

During this period, it is estimated that the Legislature approved the imposition or increase of 113 fees. Of that amount, an estimated 11 new or increased fees are assumed to be affected.</span></p><p><b><span>Transportation Revenue, Expenditure and Cost Estimate Assumptions</span></b></p><p><span>During the 2011 and 2012 legislative session, the Legislature authorized the imposition of tolls that are assumed to require new legislative approval:</span></p><p><span><span>&#8226;</span></span><span>Interstate 405 high-occupancy vehicle lanes in Engrossed House Bill 1382 (2011).</span></p><p><span><span>&#8226;</span></span><span>The Alaskan Way Viaduct replacement project in Substitute Senate Bill 6444 (2012).</span></p><p><span><span>&#8226;</span></span><span>The Columbia River Crossing project in Engrossed Substitute Senate Bill 6445 (2012).</span></p><p><span>For the Columbia River Crossing project and Interstate 405 high-occupancy vehicle lanes, it is not known when tolls would be set during the period covered by this fiscal impact statement (FY 2013&ndash;17) or the toll amount. Therefore, the state revenue and state expenditure impact from the requirement of new legislative approval to impose tolls is indeterminate.</span></p><p><span>The Legislature enacted legislation requiring the Alaskan Way Viaduct replacement project financing plan to include no more than $400 million in toll revenue (see RCW 47.01.402). Assuming the initiative requires new legislative approval to impose tolls on the Alaskan Way Viaduct replacement project, state toll revenue is estimated to decrease within a range of $22,800,000 to $33,100,000, and state toll costs are estimated to decrease within a range of $10,100,000 to $11,500,000 over five fiscal years assuming tolling does not begin until FY 2017. It is assumed that state expenditures for this project or other transportation projects will be reduced or eliminated by $12,700,000 to $21,600,000 to balance expenditures to the total decrease in state toll revenue.</span></p><p><span></span></p><p><span>In addition, legislative approval was given in Substitute Senate Bill 5700 (2011) and the transportation appropriation act for the Washington State Transportation Commission to review and adjust tolls during the 2011&ndash;13 biennium for the Tacoma Narrows Bridge and the State Route 520 corridor. Tolls for the Tacoma Narrows Bridge and the State Route 520 corridor are set annually and must be used to pay bonds (debt); pay </span><span>costs related to the operation, maintenance and management of the facility; and if necessary, repay amounts to the Motor Vehicle Fund. It is not known if it will be necessary during the 2011&ndash;13 biennium to increase tolls for the </span><span>Tacoma Narrows Bridge and the State Route 520 corridor</span><span>, and therefore impact on state revenues and expenditures is indeterminate.</span></p><p><span><strong>Business Certifications and Endorsements Assumptions</strong></span></p><p><span>During the 2012 legislative session, the Legislature authorized the imposition of fees to fund Department of Health costs for activities related to four new health care certifications and endorsements:</span></p><p><span><span>&#8226;</span></span><span>Medication assistant endorsement for certified nursing assistants in </span><span>Engrossed Substitute House Bill 2473 (2012).</span></p><p><span><span>&#8226;</span></span><span>Dental anesthesia assistant certification in Engrossed Second Substitute Senate Bill 5620 (2012).</span></p><p><span><span>&#8226;</span></span><span>Reflexologist certification in Engrossed Substitute Senate Bill 6103 (2012).</span></p><p><span><span>&#8226;</span></span><span>Medical assistant certification in Engrossed Substitute Senate Bill 6237 (2012).</span></p><p><span>RCW 43.70.110 and 43.70.250 require that state costs for each professional, occupational or business licensing program administered by the Department of Health be fully borne by the members of that profession, occupation or business.

Therefore, state fee revenue is estimated to decrease $2,454,000 and state costs are estimated to decrease $3,350,000 over five fiscal years.</span></p><p><span>During the 2011 legislative session, the Legislature authorized in Second Substitute Senate Bill 5034 the imposition of fees to fund Utility and Transportation Commission costs related to the certification of private wastewater operators.

Assuming the initiative requires new legislative approval for the commission&rsquo;s fee authority</span><span>, it is also assumed that commission will not engage in rulemaking.

1,state,1240,Initiative,Charter Schools,Authorize Forty Publicly-funded Charter Schools,"Initiative Measure No. 1240 concerns creation of a public charter school system. This measure would authorize up to forty publicly-funded charter schools open to all students, operated through approved, nonreligious, nonprofit organizations, with government oversight; and modify certain laws applicable to them as public schools. Should this measure be enacted into law?","<p><b><span>The Law as it Presently Exists</span></b></p><p><span>The legislature has provided for the education of resident children through creation of a public school system. Public schools are operated by local school districts under the overall supervision of the state superintendent of public instruction. Children between the ages of eight and eighteen must attend public school, subject to certain exceptions including enrolling in private school or receiving homeschool instruction.</span></p><p><span>School districts are local government bodies responsible for operating the &ldquo;common schools&rdquo; (kindergarten through twelfth grade) in their boundaries. A board of directors elected by the people of the district governs each school district. Each board appoints a superintendent of schools and employs teachers, administrators, and other staff as needed.School district boards must comply with certain statewide standards, but each board is responsible for selecting the number, size, and location of school buildings, employing staff, and choosing curriculum and textbooks for that district.</span></p><p><span>Each school district must allow all children residing within its geographic boundaries to enroll in its schools. Each school district has discretion to determine where an enrolled student attends school. Most districts assign students to schools on a geographic basis but may also offer students some choice of schools within a district. Many districts offer special programs that are available to students on a non-geographical basis. If agreed to by both districts, a student may attend school in another district.</span></p><p><span>Currently, public schools are established by local school district boards and cannot be created or operated by any other entity. They are primarily funded by the state. The legislature appropriates funds to the superintendent of public instruction for distribution to school districts. District allotments consider a number of factors but are primarily based on the number of students enrolled in the district. In addition to their state funding, districts may levy voter-approved special property taxes and seek funding from the federal government and/or private sources for district educational programs.</span></p><p><span>State laws impose various requirements for education programs offered by school districts. Examples of state requirements include provisions relating to student/teacher ratios, alternative education programs, special education, student transportation, bilingual instruction, highly capable students, visual and auditory screening of students, immunization, early childhood programs, school attendance, compulsory course work, food services for students, and management of school district property.</span></p><p><span>The state board of education is a state agency made up of sixteen members, including the superintendent of public instruction, members appointed by the governor, and members elected by local school boards. The board of education develops educational policy and provides strategic oversight of the public school system.</span></p><p><span>The Education Employment Relations Act (Chapter 41.59 RCW) governs school district employment relations issues. This statute provides for collective bargaining as to wages, hours, and terms and conditions of employment, and sets requirements and limitations on the collective bargaining process. Collective bargaining matters are within the jurisdiction of the public employment relations commission, a state agency.</span></p><p><b><span>The Effect of the Proposed Measure, if Approved</span></b></p><p><span>This measure would allow the authorization of a limited number of charter schools within the state&rsquo;s public school system. The measure uses the terms &ldquo;charter school&rdquo; and &ldquo;public charter school&rdquo; interchangeably, and defines the term as a public school governed by a charter school board and operated according to the terms of a charter contract, which is entered into pursuant to the terms of the measure. The measure would limit the number of charter schools to forty over a five year period, with no more than eight charter schools established per year.</span></p><p><span>A public charter school would include one or more of grades kindergarten through </span><span>twelfth<span>. Each charter school would be operated by a nonprofit corporation meeting the requirements of public benefit nonprofit corporations (a nonprofit corporation that has been designated as a tax-exempt charity under the federal internal revenue code). The nonprofit corporation could not be a sectarian or religious organization. Charter schools would be open to all students, and could only limit admission based on age group, grade level, or capacity of the school. Charter schools would be subject to supervision by the superintendent of public instruction and the state board of education.</span></span></p><p><span>Public charter schools would be created either as &ldquo;new&rdquo; charter schools (public schools that did not previously exist) or &ldquo;conversion&rdquo; charter schools (existing public schools converted into charter schools). Conversion charter schools must enroll all students already attending the school who wish to remain enrolled. If new charter schools have insufficient capacity to enroll all students who apply, admission would be determined by lottery, with preference given to siblings of already enrolled students.</span></p><p><span>The measure establishes two different ways that public charter schools could be authorized. First, the measure would create a new state agency, the Washington charter school commission. The commission could authorize charter schools anywhere in the state and enter into charter contracts with such schools. The commission would administer the charter schools it authorizes by managing, supervising, and enforcing the schools&rsquo; charter contracts. The commission would consist of nine members. The governor, the president of the state senate, and the speaker of the house of representatives would each appoint three members, and no more than five members could be of the same political party. The members would be required to have experience and expertise in public and nonprofit governance, public school education, and management and finance; and a demonstrated commitment to charter schools.</span></p><p><span>Second, the measure would allow local school district boards to authorize public charter schools within their school district boundaries. To authorize charter schools, a school district board would first have to apply to the state board of education to be approved as an authorizer of charter schools. The measure sets minimum requirements for the application.An approved school district board would be required to execute a six-year contract with the board of education, agreeing to certain responsibilities as an authorizer. Approved school district boards could then authorize and enter into charter contracts with charter schools, and would be responsible for managing, supervising, and enforcing those charter contracts. The state board of education would oversee approved school district boards and under certain circumstances could revoke its approval of the school district board as an authorizer of charter schools.</span></p><p><span>Under the measure, nonprofit corporations seeking to operate a public charter school would apply to the charter school commission or to an approved school district board. The measure sets minimum requirements for applications to operate charter schools. Applicants could apply to only one authorizer at a time, but could re-apply or apply to a different authorizer if rejected. The measure provides that preference would be given to approving applications for charter schools designed to enroll at-risk students.</span></p><p><span>A public charter school&rsquo;s basic structure and operations would be set forth in its charter contract. The charter contract would be a renewable, five-year contract between the authorizer (the state charter school commission or an approved local school board) and the charter school board. The charter school board would be appointed or selected according to the approved terms of the charter school application submitted by the nonprofit corporation. Subject to the terms of the charter contract, the charter school board could hire and discharge employees and enter into contracts to carry out the school&rsquo;s functions, including purchase or rental of real property, equipment, goods, supplies, and services. Contracts for management of the charter school could only be with nonprofit corporations. The charter school board could also borrow money and issue debt, but could not use public funds allocated to the school as collateral. The state, the charter school commission, and the local school district would not be held responsible for the debt.</span></p><p><span>The measure would set minimum requirements for what must be addressed in public charter school contracts, including academic and operational performance expectations and measures by which the performance will be judged. Charter contracts may be revoked or not renewed under certain circumstances, including failing to meet performance expectations.</span></p><p><span>Public charter schools would receive allocation of state funding based on their student enrollments, including both basic education funding and other categories of state funding for public schools. A portion of this allocation would be used to fund administrative oversight by the authorizer of the charter school (the charter school commission or the local school district board).Charter schools authorized by local school boards and conversion charter schools would also be entitled to per-pupil allocations of local levy proceeds, but new charter schools authorized by the charter school commission could receive funds only from levies submitted to voters after the school&rsquo;s start-up date. A charter school would not be able to charge tuition, levy taxes, or issue tax-backed bonds. A charter school could accept and administer grants and donations from governmental and private entities, and would be eligible to apply for state grants on the same basis as a school district.</span></p><p><span>Public charter schools would be exempt from most state statutes and rules applicable to school districts, except statutes and rules made applicable through the school&rsquo;s charter. However, charter schools would be required to comply with certain laws such as local, state, and federal laws regarding health and safety, parents&rsquo; rights, civil rights, and nondiscrimination. Charter schools would be required to employ certificated instructional staff (with certain exceptions also applicable to other public schools), would be required to provide basic education as defined by statute, would be subject to performance audits, and would be subject to open public meetings and open public records laws. Charter schools would be prohibited from engaging in sectarian practices.</span></p><p><span>Public charter schools and their employees would participate in state retirement programs for teachers, school employees, and public employee retirement systems, unless including them would jeopardize the status of the retirement systems as governmental plans for purposes of the internal revenue code and related federal laws. Charter school employees would also be eligible to participate in state employee health benefit programs.</span></p><p><span>Public charter schools would generally be subject to the same collective bargaining requirements as other public schools, but the bargaining unit for collective bargaining would be limited to employees of the charter school rather than including employees from several schools or a school district.</span></p>
"," <div><p><b><span>Fiscal Impact through Fiscal Year 2017</span></b></p><p><span>Initiative 502 would license and regulate marijuana production and distribution; tax marijuana sales; earmark marijuana-related revenues; and specifically prohibit driving under the influence of marijuana. The total fiscal impact on state and local government revenues, expenditures and costs is indeterminate due to the significant uncertainties related to federal enforcement of federal criminal laws related to marijuana. However, the initiative&rsquo;s provisions related to driving under the influence of marijuana, which are not affected by federal criminal law enforcement, are estimated to generate known state fee revenue of $4,295</span><span>,000 and known state agency costs of $2,754,000 over five fiscal years.</span></p><p><span><br /><strong>General Assumptions</strong></span></p><p><span>Federal laws classify marijuana as a controlled substance and provide criminal penalties for its manufacture, distribution, possession or use.

The inherent unreliability of existing data makes analysis extremely difficult.</span></p><p><span>Portions of the initiative pertaining to driving under the influence of marijuana and the decriminalization of marijuana possession take effect Dec. 6, 2012.</span><span>There is no date certain for implementation of the licensing and taxation portions of the initiative.Therefore, an implementation date of Dec. 1, 2013, is assumed for the purpose of developing estimates only.</span></p><p><span>Practices authorized under Chapter 69.51A RCW for medical marijuana patients and designated providers are assumed unaffected by this initiative.</span></p><p><span>Estimates are based on information provided by agencies for fiscal note 502 XIL created during the 2012 legislative session and subsequently updated and rounded to the nearest $1,000.State agencies estimates are not adjusted to account for the effect of federal criminal law enforcement on conduct authorized by the initiative.</span></p><p><span>Estimates are described using the state&rsquo;s fiscal year (FY) of July 1 through June 30.</span></p><p><span><br /><strong>State and Local Government Revenue Estimates &ndash; Assumptions</strong></span></p><p><span>The initiative creates a closed, highly regulated industry that does not presently exist anywhere. </span><span>Unlike other agricultural commodities, production would be solely for in-state consumption. In addition, the licensure and regulation provisions of the initiative could ease federal criminal law enforcement activities by identifying marijuana producers, processors and retailers. These features may prevent the development of a functioning marijuana market. Consequently, the total amount of revenue generated to state and local government could be as low as zero. Assuming a fully functioning marijuana market and the assumptions following in this summary, estimated total revenue generated to the state could be as high as $1,943,936,000 over five fiscal years. Because the range of impact is wide, the estimated impact on state and local government revenues is indeterminate, but non-zero. See Table 3.1 and Table 3.2 for details on state and local revenue impacts assuming a fully functioning marijuana market.</span></p><p><span><br /><strong>Consumption Assumptions</strong></span></p><p><span>There is no way to determine with precision the consumption of marijuana in the state before or after the effective date of the initiative. Therefore, for purposes of this fiscal impact statement only, an estimate of marijuana users was created using the U.S. Department of Health and Human Service, Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration&rsquo;s National Survey on Drug Use and Health, 2008&ndash;2009 data for Washington. The survey estimates the percentage of marijuana users to be 17.18 percent for persons 18 to 25 years of age and 5.57 percent for those 26 years of age or older. Assuming Washington&rsquo;s population of marijuana users is increasing at the same rate as the national use contained in the survey, the number of users in calendar year 2013 is estimated to be 18.4 percent for persons 18 to 25 years of age and 6.1 percent for those 26 years of age or older. Applying those percentages to the state&rsquo;s forecasted 2013 population, estimates assume </span><span>363,000 Washington marijuana users in calendar year 2013. Estimates also assume a 3 percent increase in sales beginning in 2015 to account for population growth and inflation.</span></p><p><span><br />Frequency of consumption is estimated using the pattern contained in the United Nations Office on Drug and Crime, 2006 Bulletin on Narcotics, Review of the World Cannabis Situation, page 48. The frequency of consumption by users ranged from a low of 18 percent consuming once a year to 3 percent consuming daily. Applying this consumption pattern to an estimated 363,000 Washington marijuana users, and assuming 2 grams of marijuana per use, the number of grams consumed annually is estimated at 85,100,000 grams.</span></p><p><span><br />Estimates assume all users will purchase through a Washington State Liquor Control Board (&ldquo;LCB&rdquo;) licensee; no assumption is made that a portion of these users will purchase from the illegal market or from medical marijuana retailers. </span><span>No assumption is made about current medical marijuana users migrating sales to LCB-licensed retailers. No assumption is made about migration of consumers from out of state to purchase usable marijuana in Washington. No assumption is made on the consumption of marijuana-infused products. No assumption is made concerning any change in pricing or volume of sales of liquor, beer or wine.</span></p><p><span><br /><strong>License Revenue Assumptions<i></i></strong></span></p><p><span>There is a $250 application fee and a $1,000 issuance/renewal fee for each marijuana licensee through LCB. All license fees </span><span>are deposited into the Dedicated Marijuana Fund.</span></p><p><span>We lack sufficient data to estimate the number of m</span><span>arijuana producers and marijuana processers who will apply for a license. Therefore, for purposes of this estimate, </span><span>100 m</span><span>arijuana producers and 55 marijuana processers (half of marijuana producers processing their own product and five additional processors) are assumed. No assumption is made for the number of processors of edible marijuana products because this market is unknown.</span></p><p><span>The number of retail outlets, and thus retail licenses, is determined by LCB in consultation with the Office of Financial Management, taking into account population, security and safety issues, and discouraging purchases from illegal markets. The initiative also caps retail licenses by county. Given the initiative&rsquo;s similarities with previous state monopoly liquor laws, the number of retail outlets is estimated at 328 (the same number of state and contracted liquor stores that were in operation Dec. 31, 2011).</span></p><p><span>Estimates assume that licensees will be charged fees for activities that are costs of doing business such as sampling, testing and labeling.</span></p><p><b><span><em><br /></em>Tax Revenue Assumptions</span></b></p><p><span>The initiative creates marijuana excise taxes equal to 25 percent of the selling price on each wholesale sale and retail sale of marijuana from a licensed producer, processor or retailer. All funds from marijuana excise taxes are deposited into the Dedicated Marijuana Fund.<br /><br /></span><span>General state and local sales and use taxes apply to retail sales of tangible personal property, which includes usable marijuana. </span><span>State sales tax is deposited into the State General Fund.</span></p><p><span>Although some marijuana-infused products could be exempt from retail sales tax as a food product, no assumption is made to the consumption of these products. Therefore, the estimate assumes all marijuana consumed is subject to retail sales tax.</span></p><p><span>Local government estimates use the statewide average local sales tax rate of 2.412 percent.</span></p><p><span>State business and occupation (B&amp;O) taxes will apply to these activities. </span><span>State B&amp;O taxes are deposited into the State General Fund.</span></p><p><span>The state </span><span>B&amp;O rate for retailers is 0.471 percent. The state B&amp;O rate for processors and wholesalers is 0.484 percent.</span></p><p><span>Estimates assume producers are exempt from state B&amp;O tax under RCW 82.04.330 as these are sales of agricultural products.</span></p><p><span>City B&amp;O taxes may apply. </span><span>Using data from the Washington State Department of Revenue&rsquo;s 2010 Tax Reference Manual, total local B&amp;O tax is approximately 8.6 percent of total state B&amp;O tax. Estimates assume this ratio for city B&amp;O tax revenue impacts.</span></p><p><span>For all fiscal years, estimates assume a $3 per gram producer price, a $6 per gram processor price and a $12 per gram average retail purchase price.</span></p><p><span>Prices are based on a review of current medical marijuana dispensary prices in this state.</span></p><p><span>Estimates assume 50 percent of marijuana is both produced and processed by the same seller. The remaining 50 percent is produced and then sold to a processor.</span></p><p><span>Estimates do not assume that increased consumption or competition will reduce prices.</span></p><p><span><br /><strong>Federal Fund Assumptions</strong></span></p><p><span>State and local agencies are recipients of a variety of federal funds under mutual cooperation agreements with federal agencies to reduce drug trafficking and drug production in the United States. It is assumed that the state would no longer meet the requirements of a marijuana eradication grant between the Washington State Patrol and the U.S. Department of Justice, Drug Enforcement Administration, resulting in an estimated state revenue loss of $</span><span>368,000 in FY 2014 (the estimated amount remaining of a $1.5 million grant on the effective date of the initiative). Other grants between the Washington State Patrol and the Office of National Drug Control Policy would also be at risk. Portions of these grants are passed through to local agencies. However, an estimated $202,000 of grant funds is not included as a state or local government revenue loss because it is not known what actions the Office of National Drug Control Policy will take under the terms of the grant. No revenue impact is estimated for local governments because it is assumed that grant funds will be fully spent by the effective date of the initiative.</span></p><p><span><br /><strong>Driver&rsquo;s License Administrative Actions Assumptions</strong></span></p><p><span>The initiative adds presumptive levels of intoxication for <span><span>tetrahydrocannabinol</span></span></span><span> (THC) concentration </span><span>when a driver is arrested for suspicion of driving under the influence (0.0 for drivers under the age of 21; 5.00 nanograms per milliliter of blood for drivers age 21 or older). The initiative adds the requirement that the Department of Licensing (&ldquo;DOL&rdquo;) administratively suspend or revoke the driver&rsquo;s license of a person who tests above the presumptive level of THC. Assuming an estimated increase of 4 percent in the DOL workload for administrative suspension/revocation hearings, increased fee revenue to the state is estimated at $4,295</span><span>,000 over five fiscal years.</span></p><p><span><br /><strong>State and Local Government Expenditure Estimates &ndash; Assumptions</strong></span></p><p><span>Disbursements from the Dedicated Marijuana Fund are made quarterly by LCB to state agencies to expend for specific programs and services. Disbursements are also made to specific accounts. Expenditures are dependent on the amount of revenue generated under the initiative. Because revenues could be as low as zero, estimated expenditures could be as low as zero. However, assuming the revenue generated from a fully functioning market, estimated state expenditures from the Dedicated Marijuana Fund </span><span>could be as high as $1,590,668,000 over five fiscal years. Because the range of impact is wide, the estimated impact on state and local government expenditures is indeterminate, but non-zero. See Table 3.3 for details on state distributions from the </span><span>Dedicated Marijuana Fund assuming</span><span> a fully functioning marijuana market.</span></p><p><span><br />The initiative generates an estimated range of zero to $349,341,000 over five fiscal years from state sales tax and state B&amp;O taxes. These taxes are deposited into the State General Fund, which </span><span>may be used for any governmental purpose as appropriated by the Legislature.</span></p><p><span><br />The initiative generates an estimated range of zero to $40,000 over five fiscal years from background check fees that are deposited into the F</span><span>ingerprint Identification Account. Funds from this account may </span><span>be used only to conduct identification record checks by the Washington State Patrol.</span></p><p><span><br />The initiative generates an estimated range of zero to $380,000 over five fiscal years from driving under the influence reissuance fees that are deposited into the </span><span><span>I</span></span><span>mpaired Driver Safety Account. Funds from this account may be used only to fund projects to reduce impaired driving and provide funding to local governments for costs associated with enforcing laws relating to driving and boating while under the influence of intoxicating liquor or any drug.</span></p><p><span><br />The initiative generates an estimated range of zero to $3,875,000 over five fiscal years from hearing fees and I</span><span>gnition Interlock Driver&rsquo;s License application fees </span><span>that are deposited into the Highway Safety Account. </span><span>Funds from this account may be used only for carrying out the provisions of law relating to driver licensing, driver improvement programs and traffic safety programs.</span></p><p><span><br />The initiative generates an estimated range of zero to </span><span>$119,786,000 over five fiscal years i</span><span>n local sales tax and city B&amp;O taxes. The use of these funds will be determined at the local level or as authorized by state law.</span></p><p><span><br /><strong>State and Local Government Cost Estimate &ndash; Assumptions</strong></span></p><p><span>Due to the uncertainty of enforcement of federal criminal laws related to marijuana,<span> total state costs are </span></span><span>indeterminate, but non-zero</span><span>. However, assuming full implementation of the initiative and a fully functioning marijuana market, total state costs are estimated to increase to $65,726,000 over five fiscal years. </span><span>See Table 3.4 for details on state cost impacts assuming a fully functioning marijuana market.</span></p><p><span><br /><strong>State Agency Implementation Cost Assumptions</strong></span></p><p><span>State agency costs are estimated to be $62,972,000 over five fiscal years to implement licensing, regulation and taxation of marijuana and to implement the programs and services supported by the Dedicated Marijuana Fund.Costs by agency are as follows:</span></p><p><span>LCB will incur costs estimated at $13,590,000 for rulemaking, licensure and enforcement of the initiative.</span></p><p><span>The Department of Agriculture</span><span> will incur a one-time cost of $26,000 to assist LCB</span><span> in developing </span><span>testing laboratory accreditation standards.</span></p><p><span>The Washington State Patrol will incur costs estimated at $28,000 to conduct background checks for LCB license applicants.</span></p><p><span>The Office of Administrative Hearings will incur costs estimated at $40,000 for appeals of LCB licensing denial, suspension and revocation actions.</span></p><p><span>The Office of the Attorney General will incur costs estimated at $318,000 to provide legal services for advice to LCB</span><span>.</span></p><p><span>The Department of Revenue will incur costs estimated at $90,000 to administer tax collection programs from those licensed under the initiative.</span></p><p><span>The Health Care Authority will incur costs estimated at </span><span>$38,839,000, assuming that funds deposited into the Basic Health Plan Trust Account will be used to </span><span>implement a program similar to the subsidized Basic Health Plan with increased eligibility to enroll.</span></p><p><span>The Department of Social and Health Services and Department of Health will incur costs estimated at $</span><span>10,041,000 </span><span>to implement the programs and services funded through the </span><span>Dedicated Marijuana Fund.</span></p><p><span>The University of Washington and Washington State University will have costs related to the public education and research grants from the Dedicated Marijuana Fund. Because the scope of these tasks cannot be fully determined, costs to the institutions are indeterminate, but non-zero.</span></p><p><span>To the extent the federal government chooses to pursue criminal charges against state employees for the permitting, regulation or revenue collection aspects of the initiative, the state may incur additional costs for the defense of the employee for acts performed within the scope of employment (See RCW 10.01.150). Because it is not known what actions the federal criminal law enforcement agencies may take, this cost is indeterminate.</span></p><p><span><br /><strong>State and Local Government Law Enforcement Cost Assumptions</strong></span></p><p><span>The state, counties and cities are anticipated to experience increased costs from additional driving while under the influence administrative actions, arrests, prosecutions and incarcerations. Data are not available to accurately predict the total amount of costs that will accrue to the state and local governments; however, some costs can be estimated. Known costs by state agency are estimated at $2,754,000 over five fiscal years:<b></b></span></p><p><span>The Washington State Patrol will incur costs estimated at $2,118,000 for additional training to employees on marijuana impairment. County and city law enforcement agencies may also require additional training to employees on marijuana impairment, but the cost is indeterminate because the type of training and number of employees trained will be determined at the local level.</span></p><p><span>The Washington State Patrol Toxicology Laboratory will incur costs estimated at $125,000 for blood testing for driving under the influence cases.</span></p><p><span>The Department of Licensing will incur costs estimated at $423,000 to administratively suspend or revoke driver&rsquo;s licenses for driving under the influence.</span></p><p><span>The Office of the Attorney General will incur costs estimated at $85,000 for</span><span> defending judicial appeals of DOL driving under the influence decisions.</span></p><p><span>The Administrative Office of the Courts will incur a one-time cost of $3,000 for i</span><span>nformation technology changes to the Judicial Information System.</span></p><p><span>The state, counties and cities are anticipated to experience decreased costs from fewer marijuana possession and use arrests, prosecutions and incarcerations. Data are not available to accurately predict the amount of savings that will accrue to the state and local governments. This estimate assumes that beginning Dec. 6, 2012, individuals 21 years of age or older are legally authorized to possess and use:</span></p><p><span>One ounce of useable marijuana.</span></p><p><span>Sixteen ounces of marijuana-infused product in solid form.</span></p><p><span>Seventy-two ounces of marijuana-infused product in liquid form.</span></p><p><span>Marijuana-related drug paraphernalia.</span></p><p><span>The fiscal impact statement does not estimate state costs or state savings due to social impacts from approval of the initiative.</span></p><span></span><p></p><table border=""""0"""" cellspacing=""""0"""" cellpadding=""""0""""><thead><tr><td valign=""""top"""" width=""""718"""" colspan=""""6""""><p><span>Table 3.1

1,state,74,Referendum,Same-sex Marriage,Allows Same-sex Couples to Marry,"The legislature passed Engrossed Substitute Senate Bill 6239 concerning marriage for same-sex couples, modified domestic-partnership law, and religious freedom, and voters have filed a sufficient referendum petition on this bill.This bill would allow same-sex couples to marry, preserve domestic partnerships only for seniors, and preserve the right of clergy or religious organizations to refuse to perform, recognize, or accommodate any marriage ceremony. Should this bill be approved?","<b>The Law As It Presently Exists</b>

<p>Washington law currently provides that marriage is a civil contract between a male and a female, who are both at least eighteen years old and otherwise capable of marrying. The law prohibits marriage if the parties to the marriage are of the same sex or are closely related, or if a party to the marriage is already married to somebody else. A marriage is void if one of the parties is under age seventeen, unless a superior court judge waives the age requirement based on a showing of necessity. A marriage entered into in another state or jurisdiction is recognized as valid unless Washington law would have prohibited the marriage if it had been formed here.</p>



<p>The state also currently maintains a domestic partnership registry. Two individuals of the same sex may enter into a state-registered domestic partnership if they meet certain requirements. Two individuals may also enter into a state-registered domestic partnership if at least one of them is over 62 years old. The other requirements for entering a domestic partnership are that the couple share a residence, are both at least eighteen years old, are not closely related, and neither is married or in a domestic partnership with anyone else. A legal union of two persons that was validly formed in another state or jurisdiction, and that is similar to a domestic partnership, is recognized as a domestic partnership in Washington.</p>



<p>The same rights, responsibilities, and obligations that state law grants or imposes on married couples and their families also apply to state-registered domestic partners. The terms spouse, marriage, marital, husband, wife, widow, widower, next of kin, and family, when used in state statutes, apply equally to state-registered domestic partnerships as well as to marital relationships and married persons. Similarly, laws about dissolution and invalidation of marriage apply equally to state-registered domestic partnerships. Gender-specific terms such as husband and wife used in any statute, rule, or other law are construed to be gender neutral, and applicable to individuals in state-registered domestic partnerships.</p>


<p>The Washington Law Against Discrimination prohibits discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation. This prohibition applies to employment, real estate transactions, credit transactions, insurance, and to the full enjoyment of any of the accommodations, advantages, facilities, or privileges of any place of public resort, accommodation, assemblage, or amusement.</p>



<b>The Effect of the Proposed Measure, if Approved</b>

<p>If approved, this measure would allow same-sex couples to marry. Other prohibitions on marriage, such as those based on age, being closely related, and already being married to somebody else would continue to apply. Marriage laws would apply without regard to gender. This measure specifies that gender-specific terms like husband and wife will be construed to be gender-neutral and will apply to spouses of the same sex.</p>


<p>This measure provides that clergy are not required to perform or recognize any marriage ceremony. No religious organization, or religiously-affiliated educational institution, would be required to provide accommodations, facilities, advantages, privileges, services, or goods related to the performance of a marriage. Clergy, religious organizations, and religiously-affiliated educational institutions would be immune from any civil claim or cause of action, including a claim or cause of action based on the Washington Law Against Discrimination, based on a refusal to perform or recognize any marriage, or to provide facilities, advantages, privileges, services, or goods related to the performance of a marriage.</p>


<p>State and local governments would be prohibited from basing actions relating to penalties, benefits, licenses, or contracts on the refusal of a religious organization to provide such accommodations, facilities, advantages, privileges, services, or goods. State and local governments would be prohibited from basing actions relating to penalties, benefits, or contracts on the refusal of a person associated with a religious organization to solemnize or recognize a marriage. The measure does not change or affect existing law regarding the manner in which a religious or nonprofit organization may be licensed to provide adoption, foster care, or other child-placing services.</p>


<p>This measure would also recognize, as valid in Washington, marriages between same-sex couples entered into in another state or jurisdiction and recognized as valid in that other state or jurisdiction, unless either party to the marriage was already married to a different person or the parties to the marriage are closely related. It would also recognize certain legal unions between two persons, other than marriages, entered into in another state or jurisdiction. This provision applies if the legal union provides substantially the same rights, benefits, and responsibilities as a marriage, but does not meet the definition of a domestic partnership in Washington. Washington law would then treat such couples as having the same rights and responsibilities as married spouses in this state, unless the relationship is otherwise prohibited by Washington law or the couple does not marry within one year of becoming permanent residents of Washington. Two individuals would not be prohibited from obtaining a marriage license in Washington on the basis that they validly entered into a legal union, other than a marriage, in another state or jurisdiction.</p>


<p>After June 30, 2014, state-registered domestic partnerships would be available only to couples in which one partner is at least 62 years old. The parties to existing same-sex domestic partnerships may either get married or dissolve their domestic partnership. Same-sex domestic partnerships, in which neither party is over 62 years old, will be automatically converted into a marriage as of June 30, 2014, unless the parties either get married or dissolve the domestic partnership before that date. The Secretary of State would be required to send letters to each same-sex domestic partner advising of these changes.</p>

","<b>Fiscal Impact through Fiscal Year 2017</b><p>Referendum 74 would enact legislation, Engrossed Substitute Senate Bill 6239, that allows same-sex couples to marry, applies marriage laws without regard to gender and specifies that laws using gender-specific terms like husband and wife include same-sex spouses. After 2014, existing domestic partnerships are converted to marriages, except for seniors. Fewer state domestic partnership filings and a corresponding increase in marriage licenses are estimated to decrease state revenue by $81,000 and increase county revenue by $128,000 over five fiscal years. A one-time state cost is estimated at $15,000 for required state mailings to those currently registered in the domestic partnership program.</p><b>General Assumptions</b><p>&#8226; Estimates are based on information provided by state agencies during the 2012 legislative session for Engrossed Substitute Senate Bill 6239 and the Washington State Department of Commerce Local Government Fiscal Note Program.</p><p>&#8226; In 2009, the Legislature passed Engrossed Second Substitute Senate Bill 5688, Engrossed House Bill 1616 and Engrossed Substitute House Bill 1445, which generally expanded the rights, responsibilities and obligations accorded state-registered same-sex and senior domestic partners to be equivalent to those of married spouses, except that a domestic partnership is not a marriage. Consequently, the conversion of existing same-sex domestic partnerships to marriages and the ability of same-sex couples to marry are estimated to have insignificant fiscal impact on state and local government revenues, costs or expenditures.</p><p>&#8226; The domestic partnership program continues only for couples where at least one of the partners is 62 years of age or older.</p><p>&#8226; Estimates are described using the state's fiscal year of July 1 through June 30.</p><b>State and Local Government Revenue and Expenditures Estimate &mdash; Assumptions</b><p>&#8226; Because the domestic partnership program will be limited to couples where at least one of the partners is 62 years of age or older, the Secretary of State estimates a decrease of fee revenue of $38,000 each fiscal year from fewer registrations.</p><p>&#8226; Assuming the decrease in domestic partnership filings will result in a corresponding increase in marriages, and the maximum cost of a marriage license is $64, revenue is estimated to increase $20,400 to the state and $28,000 to counties each fiscal year. For each marriage license, estimates assume the state receives $27 and the county retains $37 of each license fee. Local revenues support the county general fund, family court, family services, records preservation fund and historical programs. State revenues support the displaced homemaker program, child abuse programs, the centennial records preservation program, the state archives and the state heritage center.</p><b>State and Local Government Cost Estimate &mdash; Assumptions</b><p>&#8226; The Secretary of State estimates a one-time cost of $15,000 for two required mailings that includes a summary of this law to each partner who is registered in a domestic partnership.</p>

1,state,502,Initiative,Marijuana Legalization,"License marijuana production, distribution, and possession","This measure would license and regulate marijuana production, distribution, and possession for persons over twenty-one; remove state-law criminal and civil penalties for activities that it authorizes; tax marijuana sales; and earmark marijuana-related revenues.<br>Should this measure be enacted into law?","<div>                <p><b><span>The Law as it Presently Exists</span></b></p><p><span>It is a crime under both Washington and federal law to grow, distribute, or possess marijuana, or to involve a minor in a marijuana-related offense.</span></p><p><span>State law generally makes these crimes felonies. People convicted of felonies can serve time in state prison. People who possess 40 grams or less of marijuana, however, commit a misdemeanor. It is also a misdemeanor to make, possess, or deliver any paraphernalia used to grow, store, conceal, or use marijuana. Those convicted of misdemeanors can serve up to 90 days in a local jail. Minors who grow, distribute, or possess marijuana can be punished through juvenile court.</span></p><p><span>It is not a state law crime, however, to grow, distribute or possess marijuana with respect to certain medical uses or with respect to medical research, under certain conditions.</span></p><p><span>Washington law also makes it illegal to drive under the influence of intoxicating liquor or any drug. State law provides that every person who drives in Washington has consented to a test to find out whether he or she has alcohol or any drug in his or her blood. The results of these tests can be used in criminal trials, and in proceedings to suspend, revoke, or deny a driver&rsquo;s license. The state can also suspend, revoke, or deny the driver&rsquo;s license of a person who refuses the test.</span></p><p><span>Like state law, federal law also makes it a crime to grow, distribute, or possess marijuana. People also commit a federal crime if they provide places for growing, distributing, or storing marijuana. It is also a federal crime to use a telephone to buy or sell marijuana. Federal law makes all of these crimes felonies, except that it makes possessing marijuana a misdemeanor. Like state law, federal law allows limited use of marijuana for medical research, but does not allow medical use of marijuana.</span></p><p><span>State law cannot modify the federal laws making it a crime to grow, distribute, or possess marijuana.</span></p><p><b><span>The Effect of the Proposed Measure, if Approved</span></b></p><p><span>For persons ove<span>r</span> age 21, this measure would remove state law criminal and civil prohibitions with respect to growing, manufacturing, distributing, and possessing marijuana consistent with a state marijuana licensing and regulatory system.</span></p><p><span>Without violating state law, people over age 21 could grow, distribute, or possess marijuana, as authorized under various types of licenses. People could only buy limited amounts of marijuana at a time, and possession of marijuana by people over age 21 in amounts that do not exceed that limit would not violate state law. It would still be a crime to grow, distribute, or possess marijuana except by following the licensing and other requirements of this measure.</span></p><p><span>A license to produce marijuana would make it legal under state law to grow marijuana. A license to process marijuana would make it legal under state law to process and package marijuana. It would also make it legal under state law to make products that contain marijuana. Licensed producers and processors could sell marijuana at wholesale, but could not sell marijuana at retail directly to consumers. Licensed retailers could sell marijuana, and products containing marijuana, to consumers at retail. Licensed retailers could also sell paraphernalia items used to store or use marijuana.</span></p><p><span>It would cost $250 to apply for a license. It would also cost $1,000 every year to get and keep a license. A separate license would be required for each location. Locations could not be within 1,000 feet of any school, playground, recreation centers, child care center, park, transit center, library, or game arcade. Producers and processors could not have any financial interest in any licensed marijuana retailer.</span></p><p><span>It would still be a state law crime for a person under age 21 to grow, sell, or possess marijuana. It also would remain illegal under state law for anybody, including people who have licenses under this measure, to sell marijuana or products containing marijuana to people under 21 years old.</span></p><p><span>Licensed marijuana retailers could not sell any products other than marijuana and items used to store or use marijuana. Licensed marijuana retailers could not allow people under age 21 on their premises. Signs posted by licensed marijuana retailers that are visible to the public would be limited in size and content. No marijuana could be displayed in a way that is visible from a public place. It would be illegal to open or consume any marijuana product on the premises. Licensed marijuana retailers could be fined for violations. This measure would prohibit any person from opening a package containing marijuana in public view.</span></p><p><span>This measure would limit advertising of marijuana. Advertisements would need to be at least 1,000 feet away from any school, playground, recreation center, child care center, park, transit center, library, or game arcade. Advertisements would be banned from buses and light rail, and from government property.</span></p><p><span>The state could deny, suspend, or cancel licenses. Local governments could submit objections for the state to consider in determining whether to grant or renew a license. The state could inspect the premises of any license holder. Prior criminal conduct could be considered for purposes of granting, renewing, denying, suspending or revoking a license. The state could not issue a license to anybody under age 21. The state could adopt further rules to implement this measure.</span></p><p><span>This measure would require licensed producers and processors to submit marijuana samples to an independent lab for regular testing. The state would receive test results. Marijuana that does not satisfy state standards would be destroyed.</span></p><p><span>Sales of marijuana would be taxed. Marijuana excise taxes, in the amount of 25% of the selling price, would be collected on all sales of marijuana, at each level of production and distribution. Sale by a marijuana producer to a marijuana processor would be subject to a 25% tax. A sale by the processor to a retailer would be subject to an additional 25% tax. Sales of marijuana by a retailer would be subject to an additional 25% tax. State and local sales taxes would also apply to retail sales of marijuana.</span></p><p><span>The measure directs the state to spend designated amounts from the marijuana excise taxes, license fees, penalties, and forfeitures for certain purposes. Those purposes include spending fixed dollar amounts on: administration of this measure; a survey of youth regarding substance use and other information; a cost-benefit evaluation of the implementation of this measure; and web-based public education materials about health and safety risks posed by marijuana use. Remaining money would be distributed as follows: 50% for the state basic health plan; 15% for programs and practices aimed at prevention or reduction of substance abuse; 10% for marijuana education; 5% for other health services; 1% for research on short-term and long-terms effects of marijuana use; and .75% for a program that seeks to prevent school dropouts. The remaining 18.25% would be distributed to the state general fund.</span></p><p><span>This measure would also amend the law that prohibits driving under the influence. It would specifically prohibit driving under the influence of marijuana. Consent to testing to determine whether a driver&rsquo;s blood contains alcohol or any drug would specifically apply to marijuana as well. State law that currently specifies a level of blood alcohol concentration for driving under the influence would be amended to also specify a level of the active ingredient in marijuana. A person who drives with a higher blood concentration of that active ingredient, or who is otherwise under the influence of marijuana, would be guilty of driving under the influence. For persons under 21, any level of the active ingredient of marijuana would be prohibited.</span></p><p><span>Federal marijuana laws could still be enforced in Washington.</span></p>            </div>","<div>                <p><b><span>Fiscal Impact through Fiscal Year 2017</span></b></p><p><span>Initiative 502 would license and regulate marijuana production and distribution; tax marijuana sales; earmark marijuana-related revenues; and specifically prohibit driving under the influence of marijuana. The total fiscal impact on state and local government revenues, expenditures and costs is indeterminate due to the significant uncertainties related to federal enforcement of federal criminal laws related to marijuana. However, the initiative&rsquo;s provisions related to driving under the influence of marijuana, which are not affected by federal criminal law enforcement, are estimated to generate known state fee revenue of $4,295</span><span>,000 and known state agency costs of $2,754,000 over five fiscal years.</span></p><p><span><br /><strong>General Assumptions</strong></span></p><p><span>Federal laws classify marijuana as a controlled substance and provide criminal penalties for its manufacture, distribution, possession or use. These federal criminal laws are enforced by federal government agencies that act independently of state and local government law enforcement agencies. To the extent that the federal government continues to enforce its criminal laws related to marijuana, it would impede the activities permitted by this initiative.</span></p><p><span>Estimates rely on published surveys and reports that acknowledge the difficulty in obtaining accurate and objective data due to the product&rsquo;s illegal nature. The inherent unreliability of existing data makes analysis extremely difficult.</span></p><p><span>Portions of the initiative pertaining to driving under the influence of marijuana and the decriminalization of marijuana possession take effect Dec. 6, 2012.</span><span>There is no date certain for implementation of the licensing and taxation portions of the initiative.Therefore, an implementation date of Dec. 1, 2013, is assumed for the purpose of developing estimates only.</span></p><p><span>Practices authorized under Chapter 69.51A RCW for medical marijuana patients and designated providers are assumed unaffected by this initiative.</span></p><p><span>Estimates are based on information provided by agencies for fiscal note 502 XIL created during the 2012 legislative session and subsequently updated and rounded to the nearest $1,000.State agencies estimates are not adjusted to account for the effect of federal criminal law enforcement on conduct authorized by the initiative.</span></p><p><span>Estimates are described using the state&rsquo;s fiscal year (FY) of July 1 through June 30.</span></p><p><span><br /><strong>State and Local Government Revenue Estimates &ndash; Assumptions</strong></span></p><p><span>The initiative creates a closed, highly regulated industry that does not presently exist anywhere. </span><span>Unlike other agricultural commodities, production would be solely for in-state consumption. In addition, the licensure and regulation provisions of the initiative could ease federal criminal law enforcement activities by identifying marijuana producers, processors and retailers. These features may prevent the development of a functioning marijuana market. Consequently, the total amount of revenue generated to state and local government could be as low as zero. Assuming a fully functioning marijuana market and the assumptions following in this summary, estimated total revenue generated to the state could be as high as $1,943,936,000 over five fiscal years. Because the range of impact is wide, the estimated impact on state and local government revenues is indeterminate, but non-zero. See Table 3.1 and Table 3.2 for details on state and local revenue impacts assuming a fully functioning marijuana market.</span></p><p><span><br /><strong>Consumption Assumptions</strong></span></p><p><span>There is no way to determine with precision the consumption of marijuana in the state before or after the effective date of the initiative. Therefore, for purposes of this fiscal impact statement only, an estimate of marijuana users was created using the U.S. Department of Health and Human Service, Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration&rsquo;s National Survey on Drug Use and Health, 2008&ndash;2009 data for Washington. The survey estimates the percentage of marijuana users to be 17.18 percent for persons 18 to 25 years of age and 5.57 percent for those 26 years of age or older. Assuming Washington&rsquo;s population of marijuana users is increasing at the same rate as the national use contained in the survey, the number of users in calendar year 2013 is estimated to be 18.4 percent for persons 18 to 25 years of age and 6.1 percent for those 26 years of age or older. Applying those percentages to the state&rsquo;s forecasted 2013 population, estimates assume </span><span>363,000 Washington marijuana users in calendar year 2013. Estimates also assume a 3 percent increase in sales beginning in 2015 to account for population growth and inflation.</span></p><p><span><br />Frequency of consumption is estimated using the pattern contained in the United Nations Office on Drug and Crime, 2006 Bulletin on Narcotics, Review of the World Cannabis Situation, page 48. The frequency of consumption by users ranged from a low of 18 percent consuming once a year to 3 percent consuming daily. Applying this consumption pattern to an estimated 363,000 Washington marijuana users, and assuming 2 grams of marijuana per use, the number of grams consumed annually is estimated at 85,100,000 grams.</span></p><p><span><br />Estimates assume all users will purchase through a Washington State Liquor Control Board (&ldquo;LCB&rdquo;) licensee; no assumption is made that a portion of these users will purchase from the illegal market or from medical marijuana retailers. </span><span>No assumption is made about current medical marijuana users migrating sales to LCB-licensed retailers. No assumption is made about migration of consumers from out of state to purchase usable marijuana in Washington. No assumption is made on the consumption of marijuana-infused products. No assumption is made concerning any change in pricing or volume of sales of liquor, beer or wine.</span></p><p><span><br /><strong>License Revenue Assumptions<i></i></strong></span></p><p><span>There is a $250 application fee and a $1,000 issuance/renewal fee for each marijuana licensee through LCB. All license fees </span><span>are deposited into the Dedicated Marijuana Fund.</span></p><p><span>We lack sufficient data to estimate the number of m</span><span>arijuana producers and marijuana processers who will apply for a license. Therefore, for purposes of this estimate, </span><span>100 m</span><span>arijuana producers and 55 marijuana processers (half of marijuana producers processing their own product and five additional processors) are assumed. No assumption is made for the number of processors of edible marijuana products because this market is unknown.</span></p><p><span>The number of retail outlets, and thus retail licenses, is determined by LCB in consultation with the Office of Financial Management, taking into account population, security and safety issues, and discouraging purchases from illegal markets. The initiative also caps retail licenses by county. Given the initiative&rsquo;s similarities with previous state monopoly liquor laws, the number of retail outlets is estimated at 328 (the same number of state and contracted liquor stores that were in operation Dec. 31, 2011).</span></p><p><span>Estimates assume that licensees will be charged fees for activities that are costs of doing business such as sampling, testing and labeling.</span></p><p><b><span><em><br /></em>Tax Revenue Assumptions</span></b></p><p><span>The initiative creates marijuana excise taxes equal to 25 percent of the selling price on each wholesale sale and retail sale of marijuana from a licensed producer, processor or retailer. All funds from marijuana excise taxes are deposited into the Dedicated Marijuana Fund.<br /><br /></span><span>General state and local sales and use taxes apply to retail sales of tangible personal property, which includes usable marijuana. </span><span>State sales tax is deposited into the State General Fund.</span></p><p><span>Although some marijuana-infused products could be exempt from retail sales tax as a food product, no assumption is made to the consumption of these products. Therefore, the estimate assumes all marijuana consumed is subject to retail sales tax.</span></p><p><span>Local government estimates use the statewide average local sales tax rate of 2.412 percent.</span></p><p><span>State business and occupation (B&amp;O) taxes will apply to these activities. </span><span>State B&amp;O taxes are deposited into the State General Fund.</span></p><p><span>The state </span><span>B&amp;O rate for retailers is 0.471 percent. The state B&amp;O rate for processors and wholesalers is 0.484 percent.</span></p><p><span>Estimates assume producers are exempt from state B&amp;O tax under RCW 82.04.330 as these are sales of agricultural products.</span></p><p><span>City B&amp;O taxes may apply. </span><span>Using data from the Washington State Department of Revenue&rsquo;s 2010 Tax Reference Manual, total local B&amp;O tax is approximately 8.6 percent of total state B&amp;O tax. Estimates assume this ratio for city B&amp;O tax revenue impacts.</span></p><p><span>For all fiscal years, estimates assume a $3 per gram producer price, a $6 per gram processor price and a $12 per gram average retail purchase price.</span></p><p><span>Prices are based on a review of current medical marijuana dispensary prices in this state.</span></p><p><span>Estimates assume 50 percent of marijuana is both produced and processed by the same seller. The remaining 50 percent is produced and then sold to a processor.</span></p><p><span>Estimates do not assume that increased consumption or competition will reduce prices.</span></p><p><span><br /><strong>Federal Fund Assumptions</strong></span></p><p><span>State and local agencies are recipients of a variety of federal funds under mutual cooperation agreements with federal agencies to reduce drug trafficking and drug production in the United States. It is assumed that the state would no longer meet the requirements of a marijuana eradication grant between the Washington State Patrol and the U.S. Department of Justice, Drug Enforcement Administration, resulting in an estimated state revenue loss of $</span><span>368,000 in FY 2014 (the estimated amount remaining of a $1.5 million grant on the effective date of the initiative). Other grants between the Washington State Patrol and the Office of National Drug Control Policy would also be at risk. Portions of these grants are passed through to local agencies. However, an estimated $202,000 of grant funds is not included as a state or local government revenue loss because it is not known what actions the Office of National Drug Control Policy will take under the terms of the grant. No revenue impact is estimated for local governments because it is assumed that grant funds will be fully spent by the effective date of the initiative.</span></p><p><span><br /><strong>Driver&rsquo;s License Administrative Actions Assumptions</strong></span></p><p><span>The initiative adds presumptive levels of intoxication for <span><span>tetrahydrocannabinol</span></span></span><span> (THC) concentration </span><span>when a driver is arrested for suspicion of driving under the influence (0.0 for drivers under the age of 21; 5.00 nanograms per milliliter of blood for drivers age 21 or older). The initiative adds the requirement that the Department of Licensing (&ldquo;DOL&rdquo;) administratively suspend or revoke the driver&rsquo;s license of a person who tests above the presumptive level of THC. Assuming an estimated increase of 4 percent in the DOL workload for administrative suspension/revocation hearings, increased fee revenue to the state is estimated at $4,295</span><span>,000 over five fiscal years.</span></p><p><span><br /><strong>State and Local Government Expenditure Estimates &ndash; Assumptions</strong></span></p><p><span>Disbursements from the Dedicated Marijuana Fund are made quarterly by LCB to state agencies to expend for specific programs and services. Disbursements are also made to specific accounts. Expenditures are dependent on the amount of revenue generated under the initiative. Because revenues could be as low as zero, estimated expenditures could be as low as zero. However, assuming the revenue generated from a fully functioning market, estimated state expenditures from the Dedicated Marijuana Fund </span><span>could be as high as $1,590,668,000 over five fiscal years. Because the range of impact is wide, the estimated impact on state and local government expenditures is indeterminate, but non-zero. See Table 3.3 for details on state distributions from the </span><span>Dedicated Marijuana Fund assuming</span><span> a fully functioning marijuana market.</span></p><p><span><br />The initiative generates an estimated range of zero to $349,341,000 over five fiscal years from state sales tax and state B&amp;O taxes. These taxes are deposited into the State General Fund, which </span><span>may be used for any governmental purpose as appropriated by the Legislature.</span></p><p><span><br />The initiative generates an estimated range of zero to $40,000 over five fiscal years from background check fees that are deposited into the F</span><span>ingerprint Identification Account. Funds from this account may </span><span>be used only to conduct identification record checks by the Washington State Patrol.</span></p><p><span><br />The initiative generates an estimated range of zero to $380,000 over five fiscal years from driving under the influence reissuance fees that are deposited into the </span><span><span>I</span></span><span>mpaired Driver Safety Account. Funds from this account may be used only to fund projects to reduce impaired driving and provide funding to local governments for costs associated with enforcing laws relating to driving and boating while under the influence of intoxicating liquor or any drug.</span></p><p><span><br />The initiative generates an estimated range of zero to $3,875,000 over five fiscal years from hearing fees and I</span><span>gnition Interlock Driver&rsquo;s License application fees </span><span>that are deposited into the Highway Safety Account. </span><span>Funds from this account may be used only for carrying out the provisions of law relating to driver licensing, driver improvement programs and traffic safety programs.</span></p><p><span><br />The initiative generates an estimated range of zero to </span><span>$119,786,000 over five fiscal years i</span><span>n local sales tax and city B&amp;O taxes. The use of these funds will be determined at the local level or as authorized by state law.</span></p><p><span><br /><strong>State and Local Government Cost Estimate &ndash; Assumptions</strong></span></p><p><span>Due to the uncertainty of enforcement of federal criminal laws related to marijuana,<span> total state costs are </span></span><span>indeterminate, but non-zero</span><span>. However, assuming full implementation of the initiative and a fully functioning marijuana market, total state costs are estimated to increase to $65,726,000 over five fiscal years. </span><span>See Table 3.4 for details on state cost impacts assuming a fully functioning marijuana market.</span></p><p><span><br /><strong>State Agency Implementation Cost Assumptions</strong></span></p><p><span>State agency costs are estimated to be $62,972,000 over five fiscal years to implement licensing, regulation and taxation of marijuana and to implement the programs and services supported by the Dedicated Marijuana Fund.Costs by agency are as follows:</span></p><p><span>LCB will incur costs estimated at $13,590,000 for rulemaking, licensure and enforcement of the initiative.</span></p><p><span>The Department of Agriculture</span><span> will incur a one-time cost of $26,000 to assist LCB</span><span> in developing </span><span>testing laboratory accreditation standards.</span></p><p><span>The Washington State Patrol will incur costs estimated at $28,000 to conduct background checks for LCB license applicants.</span></p><p><span>The Office of Administrative Hearings will incur costs estimated at $40,000 for appeals of LCB licensing denial, suspension and revocation actions.</span></p><p><span>The Office of the Attorney General will incur costs estimated at $318,000 to provide legal services for advice to LCB</span><span>.</span></p><p><span>The Department of Revenue will incur costs estimated at $90,000 to administer tax collection programs from those licensed under the initiative.</span></p><p><span>The Health Care Authority will incur costs estimated at </span><span>$38,839,000, assuming that funds deposited into the Basic Health Plan Trust Account will be used to </span><span>implement a program similar to the subsidized Basic Health Plan with increased eligibility to enroll.</span></p><p><span>The Department of Social and Health Services and Department of Health will incur costs estimated at $</span><span>10,041,000 </span><span>to implement the programs and services funded through the </span><span>Dedicated Marijuana Fund.</span></p><p><span>The University of Washington and Washington State University will have costs related to the public education and research grants from the Dedicated Marijuana Fund. Because the scope of these tasks cannot be fully determined, costs to the institutions are indeterminate, but non-zero.</span></p><p><span>To the extent the federal government chooses to pursue criminal charges against state employees for the permitting, regulation or revenue collection aspects of the initiative, the state may incur additional costs for the defense of the employee for acts performed within the scope of employment (See RCW 10.01.150). Because it is not known what actions the federal criminal law enforcement agencies may take, this cost is indeterminate.</span></p><p><span><br /><strong>State and Local Government Law Enforcement Cost Assumptions</strong></span></p><p><span>The state, counties and cities are anticipated to experience increased costs from additional driving while under the influence administrative actions, arrests, prosecutions and incarcerations. Data are not available to accurately predict the total amount of costs that will accrue to the state and local governments; however, some costs can be estimated. Known costs by state agency are estimated at $2,754,000 over five fiscal years:<b></b></span></p><p><span>The Washington State Patrol will incur costs estimated at $2,118,000 for additional training to employees on marijuana impairment. County and city law enforcement agencies may also require additional training to employees on marijuana impairment, but the cost is indeterminate because the type of training and number of employees trained will be determined at the local level.</span></p><p><span>The Washington State Patrol Toxicology Laboratory will incur costs estimated at $125,000 for blood testing for driving under the influence cases.</span></p><p><span>The Department of Licensing will incur costs estimated at $423,000 to administratively suspend or revoke driver&rsquo;s licenses for driving under the influence.</span></p><p><span>The Office of the Attorney General will incur costs estimated at $85,000 for</span><span> defending judicial appeals of DOL driving under the influence decisions.</span></p><p><span>The Administrative Office of the Courts will incur a one-time cost of $3,000 for i</span><span>nformation technology changes to the Judicial Information System.</span></p><p><span>The state, counties and cities are anticipated to experience decreased costs from fewer marijuana possession and use arrests, prosecutions and incarcerations. Data are not available to accurately predict the amount of savings that will accrue to the state and local governments. This estimate assumes that beginning Dec. 6, 2012, individuals 21 years of age or older are legally authorized to possess and use:</span></p><p><span>One ounce of useable marijuana.</span></p><p><span>Sixteen ounces of marijuana-infused product in solid form.</span></p><p><span>Seventy-two ounces of marijuana-infused product in liquid form.</span></p><p><span>Marijuana-related drug paraphernalia.</span></p><p><span>The fiscal impact statement does not estimate state costs or state savings due to social impacts from approval of the

1,state,8221,Joint Resolution,State Debt,Calculations for determining how much debt Washington may assume,"The Legislature has proposed a constitutional amendment on implementing the Commission on State Debt recommendations regarding Washington's debt limit.   This amendment would, starting July 1, 2014, phase-down the debt limit percentage in three steps from nine to eight percent and modify the calculation date, calculation period, and the term general state revenues.  Should this constitutional amendment be approved?","<b>The Constitutional Provision as it Presently Exists</b><p>Article VIII, section 1 of the Washington State Constitution establishes a limit on the amount of certain debt the state may assume. It does so by limiting the annual cost of principal and interest payments the state may agree to pay. When contracting for new debt, the state may not agree to annual payments of principal and interest that would raise the total annual payments of principal and interest above nine percent of the average of the prior three years of &ldquo;general state revenues,&rdquo; as defined by the Constitution.</p><p>Article VIII, section 1 defines &ldquo;general state revenues&rdquo; to be used in calculating the state debt limit. In general, the term includes all state moneys received in the state treasury that are not dedicated to a specific use. Examples of state moneys that are not part of &ldquo;general state revenues&rdquo; include fees or revenues derived from state ownership or operation of projects or facilities; federal and private grant moneys dedicated to specific purposes; money in retirement system funds; and money received from taxes levied for specific purposes (such as the state property tax, which is dedicated by statute to the support of common schools).</p><p>Not all state debt is subject to the debt limit in Article VIII, section 1. For example, bonds payable from the gas tax and motor vehicle license fees are excluded, as are bonds payable from income received from investing the Permanent Common School Fund.</p><p>Article VIII, section 1 pledges the full faith, credit, and taxing power of the state to the payment of debt created pursuant to the section.</p><b>The Effect of the Proposed Amendment, if Approved</b><p>The amendment would change the calculations for determining how much debt Washington may assume. First, it would reduce the percentage rate used in calculating the state debt limit, from 9.0 percent of &ldquo;general state revenues,&rdquo; as currently provided; to 8.5 percent starting July 1, 2014; 8.25 percent starting July 1, 2016; and 8.0 percent starting July 1, 2034. The amendment also would clarify that this percentage rate calculation is applied at the time the state enters into contracts to assume debt.</p><p>Second, beginning July 1, 2014, the amount of new debt that may be contracted each year would be calculated based on the average of the prior six years of &ldquo;general state revenues,&rdquo; rather than the prior three years, as it is currently.</p><p>Third, the amendment would change the definition of &ldquo;general state revenues&rdquo; to include the state property tax, starting July 1, 2014. This change would allow the state property tax to be included in &ldquo;general state revenues&rdquo; when calculating the debt limit. The state property tax is dedicated by statute to the support of common schools, and that dedication to schools would not be changed by the amendment.</p>",,https://wei.sos.wa.gov/agency/osos/en/press_and_research/PreviousElections/2012/General-Election/Pages/Online-Voters-Guide.aspx,,,,,,,,
1,state,8223,Joint Resolution,University Investments,Eliminates constitutional prohibition for state universities to invest public monies in private stocks and bonds.,"The Legislature has proposed a constitutional amendment on investments by the University of Washington and Washington State University.  This amendment would create an exception to constitutional restrictions on investing public funds by allowing these universities to invest specified public funds as authorized by the legislature, including in private companies or stock.  Should this constitutional amendment be approved?","<p><b>The Constitutional Provision as it Presently Exists</b></p><p>The state constitution generally limits the investment of state funds. Article VIII, sections 5 and 7 and article XII, section 9 prohibit the investment of state funds in the stocks and bonds of private companies, associations, or corporations. Previous constitutional amendments have made exceptions to these restrictions to permit the legislature to authorize investment of certain funds in private stocks and bonds. Funds that currently may be invested in private stocks and bonds include public pension and retirement funds, industrial insurance (workers' compensation) funds, funds held in trust for persons with developmental disabilities, the permanent common school fund, and permanent higher education funds. Permanent higher education funds are funds primarily derived from the sale, lease, or management of lands granted by the United States to the State of Washington at statehood for educational purposes.</p><p><b>The Effect of the Proposed Amendment, if Approved</b></p><p>If the amendment were adopted, it would create a new exception to the constitutional restrictions on investing public funds. The state constitution would no longer prohibit investment of public monies of the University of Washington and Washington State University in private stocks and bonds. The legislature would specify which funds of the universities could be invested and determine how the funds could be invested.</p>",,https://wei.sos.wa.gov/agency/osos/en/press_and_research/PreviousElections/2012/General-Election/Pages/Online-Voters-Guide.aspx,,,,,,,,
