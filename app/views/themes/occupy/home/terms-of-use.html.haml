    By using this site, you certify that you agree to have information about how you use this site collected.  For people who read the discussion and take positions, we are collecting session logs.  These logs are completely anonymized â€“ we aren't collecting any information in these logs that could identify you personally. For people who post new content, the items on the site are all publicly visible on the internet.

  %p
    For people who read information on the site and perhaps take positions, we are collecting data about users' interaction with the website, including mouse clicks. We are also recording a hash of the login name of any logged in user.  A "hash" of the login name means that we will take the actual name and transform it into a unique code that will only correspond to that particular name.  However, this will be a one-way cryptographic transformation: the stored information will let us determine whether this is the same name when used again, but won't let us (or anyone else) determine the actual name from the hash.  

  %p
    For people who are posting new content, the items on the site are all publicly visible on the internet.  The system is also configured to send a notification on Twitter from @OccupyTempcheck, so that others can be easily notified that there is a new and potentially interesting item available on the site. These notifications all come through @OccupyTempcheck, not from any personal account you might have.
