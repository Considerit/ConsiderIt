# Consider.it

[Consider.it](http://consider.it) helps large groups of people make decisions. Each person crafts a pro/con list, where they can author points and/or include points by other people that they think are important. From this information, the important factors - pro and con - can be identified. Moreover, ConsiderIt sheds lights on the sticking points for opposers, as well as the common ground that both supporters and opposers find important. 

Consider.it was initially created to support the [Living Voters Guide](http://livingvotersguide.org), a citizen-powered voters guide for WA state.

The creator and maintainer is [Travis Kriplean](<tkriplean@gmail.com>).
