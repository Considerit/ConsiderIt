<b>The Constitutional Provision as it Presently Exists</b>
<p>Article VIII, section 1 of the Washington State Constitution establishes a limit on the amount of certain debt the state may assume. It does so by limiting the annual cost of principal and interest payments the state may agree to pay. When contracting for new debt, the state may not agree to annual payments of principal and interest that would raise the total annual payments of principal and interest above nine percent of the average of the prior three years of &ldquo;general state revenues,&rdquo; as defined by the Constitution.</p>
<p>Article VIII, section 1 defines &ldquo;general state revenues&rdquo; to be used in calculating the state debt limit. In general, the term includes all state moneys received in the state treasury that are not dedicated to a specific use. Examples of state moneys that are not part of &ldquo;general state revenues&rdquo; include fees or revenues derived from state ownership or operation of projects or facilities; federal and private grant moneys dedicated to specific purposes; money in retirement system funds; and money received from taxes levied for specific purposes (such as the state property tax, which is dedicated by statute to the support of common schools).</p>
<p>Not all state debt is subject to the debt limit in Article VIII, section 1. For example, bonds payable from the gas tax and motor vehicle license fees are excluded, as are bonds payable from income received from investing the Permanent Common School Fund.</p>
<p>Article VIII, section 1 pledges the full faith, credit, and taxing power of the state to the payment of debt created pursuant to the section.</p>
<b>The Effect of the Proposed Amendment, if Approved</b>
<p>The amendment would change the calculations for determining how much debt Washington may assume. First, it would reduce the percentage rate used in calculating the state debt limit, from 9.0 percent of &ldquo;general state revenues,&rdquo; as currently provided; to 8.5 percent starting July 1, 2014; 8.25 percent starting July 1, 2016; and 8.0 percent starting July 1, 2034. The amendment also would clarify that this percentage rate calculation is applied at the time the state enters into contracts to assume debt.</p>
<p>Second, beginning July 1, 2014, the amount of new debt that may be contracted each year would be calculated based on the average of the prior six years of &ldquo;general state revenues,&rdquo; rather than the prior three years, as it is currently.</p>
<p>Third, the amendment would change the definition of &ldquo;general state revenues&rdquo; to include the state property tax, starting July 1, 2014. This change would allow the state property tax to be included in &ldquo;general state revenues&rdquo; when calculating the debt limit. The state property tax is dedicated by statute to the support of common schools, and that dedication to schools would not be changed by the amendment.</p>
