            Kevin saw that there was a deeper problem of listening and critical 
            thinking behind our political strife. While trudging through the 
            startup world, he learned about Consider.it. He badgered Travis for 
            a meeting and asked the question that always starts an 
            adventure: "How can I help?"

            align the opinions of employees during organizational change

            and deliberation in decentralized online communities. Finally,
