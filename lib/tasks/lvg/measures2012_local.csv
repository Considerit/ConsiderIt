The principal and interest on the bonds (the debt) would be repaid by increased property taxes in excess of normal property tax limits.</p> <p>The bonds must be issued within ten years of the vote and each bond must mature within thirty years of its sale.  A portion of the funds raised, equal to 1% of the estimated construction expenditures on the Project, will be spent on public works for art in accordance with Seattle Municipal Code Section 20.32.030. </p> <p>The funds raised by the bonds would be used for capital costs of the Project.  Section 2 of Ordinance No. 123922 details the nature of those costs.  The City also shall seek supplemental, matching or additional funds to pay all or part of the cost of the Project.  If the Project is completed and there are remaining funds from the sale of the bonds, those funds may be used for other waterfront improvements or infrastructure construction, repair or replacement, or for the payment of debt service on bonds, all as later determined by ordinance.  Should there be insufficient funds from the bonds to complete the Project, the City may delay completion of all or any element of the Project until adequate funding is available, or eliminate any part of the Project.</p> <p>Property taxes will be raised in excess of regular property tax levies, without limitation as to rate, but only in such amounts sufficient to pay the principal and interest (debt service) on the bonds.  The annual debt service for all $290 million in bonds approved by this measure is estimated to be $19 million per year over a 30-year period, assuming a 5% interest rate.  Once the full $290 million in bonds have been sold, the impact to property owners is projected to be approximately $59 annually for a median-value home worth $360,000.</p>",http://your.kingcounty.gov/elections/contests/measureinfo.aspx?cid=45661&eid=1253,King,,,,,1,CITY OF SHORELINE,1,Proposition,Proposition  1,Acquisition and Local Control of Seattle Water Services in Shoreline,"The Shoreline City Council passed Ordinance No. 644 concerning the City of Shoreline’s acquisition and operation of water services of Seattle Public Utilities (SPU) within Shoreline west of Interstate 5.
