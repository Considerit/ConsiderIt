[Consider.it][1] is a web-based discussion system that creates civil, organized, and efficient online dialogue by visually summarizing what your community thinks and why. It helps focus discussion even when lots of people participate.

[1]: <https://consider.it>

Consider.it has been used in a variety of contexts, including: 
- public engagement between cities and citizens
- ideation and deliberation platform for open source communities
- participatory strategic planning for non-profits and political organizing
- decision making support for cohousing communities
- aide for teaching critical thinking in k-12 classrooms
- academics peer reviewing articles before publication
- debating tv shows

The creator and maintainer is [Travis Kriplean](https://github.com/tkriplean/). Travis invented Consider.it in the course of his PhD work on supporting reflective public dialogue at the University of Washington, after which he went indie and bootstrapped his continued efforts to create technology that helps people listen to each other.

On the state of Consider.it
---------------------------

Feel free to weigh in on design and development priorities! See https://consider.consider.it.

Built on
--------

- [Ruby on Rails](http://rubyonrails.org/) — Our back end is a Rails app. It is possible that we will move to a pure Javascript stack. 
- [Statebus.js](https://stateb.us/) – Statebus provides reactive state management. We use an early client-only version of Statebus called ActiveREST. 
- [React.js](https://facebook.github.io/react/) – Our front end is a Statebus-wrapped version of React.js.
- [MySQL](https://www.mysql.com/) — MySQL is our database.


Developer installation
---------------------

See (and improve?) the [development installation guide](docs/developer_installation_guide.md).

Deployment guide
----------------

Missing! If you're trying to deploy, reach out to [travis@consider.it](travis@consider.it) for support, and we'll work together to create a guide. 

Contributing
------------

Time permitting, Travis would like collaborate with you! Well, as long as you are a [considerate human being](docs/code-of-conduct.md). 

Note that there are still lots of todos to lower the barrier to making contributions, such as identifying good first-time projects. In the meantime, please be patient! And if you want to be a brave, early helper, please reach out to [travis@consider.it](travis@consider.it).

Note that if you want your pull requests to be merged, you'll first have to agree to a Contributor License Agreement. This gives me the option to dual license Consider.it in the future, while you retain your rights to your contribution.
