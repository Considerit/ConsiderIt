  :long_description => '<b>The Constitutional Provision as it
    Presently Exists</b> <br> The Washington Constitution currently
    contains two provisions relating to the length of time that a
    person must be a resident of Washington in order to vote. One of
    those provisions, article VI, section 1A, is inoperative because
    of court decisions and a more recent amendment to the other
    provision, article VI, section 1.<br> &nbsp;<br> Article VI,
    section 1, provides that all citizens who are at least eighteen
    years old are entitled to vote if they have lived in the state,
    county, and precinct for at least 30 days before the election. The
    second provision, article VI, section 1A, states that all citizens
    of the United States who become residents of Washington during a
    presidential election year may vote for the offices of president
    and vice president if they resided in Washington for at least 60
    days before the election.<br> &nbsp;<br> The voters added article
    VI, section 1A, to the state constitution in 1966 as Amendment
    46. At that time, article VI, section 1, of the state constitution
    required voters to reside in the state for a full year prior to
    voting and, in addition, required that they live in the county for
    90 days and the city, town, ward, or precinct for 30 days before
    the election. Therefore, when section 1A was added to the
    constitution in 1966, it provided a more lenient residency
    requirement so that new residents of the state could vote for
    president and vice president after a shorter, 60-day period of
    residency. <br> &nbsp;<br> After the voters approved adding
    section 1A to the state constitution, the United States Supreme
    Court ruled that any requirement that voters live in a particular
    place longer than 30 days in order to vote is
    unconstitutional. Based upon that holding, the Washington Supreme
    Court held that the 90-day county and one-year state residency
    requirements stated in article VI, section 1, were
    unconstitutional. Washington voters then approved amending article
    VI, section 1, to read as it does today in order to conform to the
    court decisions, but this amendment did not repeal or change
    article VI, section 1A. Washington law therefore currently
    entitles all otherwise-qualified citizens to vote if they have
    resided within the state, county, and precinct for at least 30
    days. <br> &nbsp;<br> Article VI, section 1A, remains part of the
    state constitution, but has no operative effect.<br> &nbsp;<br>
    <b>The Effect of the Proposed Amendment, if Approved</b> This
    measure proposes to amend the state constitution to remove article
    VI, section 1A, from the state constitution. The state
    constitution would continue to entitle all otherwise-eligible
    citizens of the United States to vote if they have resided in
    Washington, and in their county and precinct, for at least 30 days
    before the election.<p>',

    historical general state revenues must be adjusted to reflect
    statutory changes to revenue dedication.<br> &nbsp;<br> The

    stabilization account, subject to two limitations. First, no
    transfer of &ldquo;extraordinary revenue growth&rdquo; is required
    where annual average state employment growth during the preceding
    fiscal biennium averaged less than one percent per fiscal
    year. Second, no transfer of &ldquo;extraordinary revenue
    growth&rdquo; is required unless the transfer would exceed the
    amount already transferred to the budget stabilization account

  :long_description => '<b>The Law as it Presently Exists</b><br> The
    legislature has enacted various laws that direct where and how
    tolls can be set for bridges, ferries, tunnels, roads, and related
    facilities. Those laws also restrict the ways in which toll
    revenue can be used. Initiative Measure No. 1125 would impose
    additional restrictions on the use of toll revenue.<br> &nbsp;<br>
    The Eighteenth Amendment to the Washington Constitution requires
    that certain state revenue be used only for &ldquo;highway
    purposes.&rdquo; That amendment, which was approved in 1944,
    provides that the following revenue must be paid into the state
    treasury and placed in a special fund to be used exclusively for
    &ldquo;highway purposes&rdquo;: all fees the state collects as
    license fees for motor vehicles; all excise taxes the state
    collects on the sale, distribution, or use of motor vehicle fuel;
    and all other state revenue &ldquo;intended to be used for highway
    purposes.&rdquo; That fund is the &ldquo;motor vehicle fund&rdquo;
    established in RCW 46.68.070. The Eighteenth Amendment also lists
    some uses that must be considered &ldquo;highway purposes,&rdquo;
    including the necessary operating, engineering, and legal expenses
    connected with the administration of public highways, county
    roads, and city streets; and the construction, reconstruction,
    maintenance, repair, and betterment of public highways, county
    roads, bridges, and city streets.<br> &nbsp;<br> Since well before
    the adoption of the Eighteenth Amendment, the legislature has
    authorized the use of tolls as one means of paying for the
    acquisition, construction, and operation of bridges, ferries,
    tunnels, roads, and related facilities. That authority includes
    the use of tolls to retire bonds issued to finance acquisition and
    construction of bridges, ferries, tunnels, roads, and related
    facilities; tolls used for that purpose must be deposited in
    special trust funds kept separate from all other funds.<br>
    &nbsp;<br> Under current law, the legislature must authorize the
    collection of tolls but it can delegate the authority to set the
    amounts of tolls. The legislature has designated the state
    Transportation Commission as the &ldquo;tolling authority&rdquo;
    responsible for setting most tolls, under standards and guidelines
    established in law to ensure that the revenue generated by tolls
    is sufficient to pay maintenance and operating costs for the
    facility; pay principal and interest on bonds, related financing
    costs, and insurance; and reimburse the motor vehicle fund for any
    money used from that fund to pay for bonds.&nbsp; Unless otherwise
    provided in law, all revenue from a toll facility is to be used
    for that facility, and tolls may continue to be collected after
    initial construction has been paid for to fund additional
    capacity, maintenance, and operation of the facility.<br>
    &nbsp;<br> <b>The Effect of the Proposed Measure, if
    Approved</b><br> Initiative Measure No. 1125 would require that
    toll amounts be set by the legislature by majority vote, rather
    than by the Transportation Commission, and would make the setting
    of toll amounts subject to statutes that require preparation of
    various reports and analyses relating to costs. It would require
    that tolls be &ldquo;uniform and consistent&rdquo; and would not
    allow variable pricing of tolls. (&ldquo;Variable priced&rdquo;
    tolls typically are higher during periods of traffic congestion
    and lower at other times of the day or week.)<br> &nbsp;<br> While
    the measure would leave in place the authority to collect and use
    tolls for the preservation, maintenance, management, and operation
    of a facility, it would add provisions that limit the use of some
    tolls to construction and capital improvement only and that
    require tolls on future facilities to end after the cost of the
    project is paid. The measure would require revenue from tolls to
    be used only for purposes &ldquo;consistent with&rdquo; the
    Eighteenth Amendment, and would prohibit any revenue in the motor
    vehicle fund or any toll fund from being transferred to the
    &ldquo;general fund or other funds&rdquo; and used for
    &ldquo;non-transportation purposes.&rdquo;<br> &nbsp;<br> The
    measure would restate the existing requirement that tolls must be
    used on the facility for which they are collected, explicitly
    referencing the Interstate 90 floating bridge. The measure also
    would prohibit the state or a state agency from transferring or
    using &ldquo;gas-tax-funded or toll-funded lanes on state
    highways&rdquo; for &ldquo;non-highway purposes.&rdquo; <p> ',

    toll lanes cannot be quantified, the fiscal impact on state and
    local governments from these provisions is indeterminate.<br>
    &nbsp;<br> <b>General Assumptions</b><br> <ul> <li>The initiative
    is effective Dec. 8, 2011, and applies prospectively.</li> <li>The
    term &ldquo;highway purposes&rdquo; is used to describe the 18th
    Amendment purposes. For purposes of the fiscal impact statement,
    &ldquo;highway purposes&rdquo; excludes operating funds for
    transit and other funding for transit, bicycle and pedestrian
    facilities that do not directly benefit the highway system.</li>
    <li>Estimates are described using the state&rsquo;s fiscal year
    (FY) of July 1 through June 30.</li> <li>The fiscal impact
    statement covers the period FY 2012 through FY 2017.</li>
    <li>Fiscal impacts are measured against current law, enacted
    budgets and bond authorizations.</li> <li>Bonds are a form of
    state debt used to finance capital construction and transportation
    projects. Bonds enable the state to receive funds today on the
    promise that the funds will be repaid with interest. Bonds must be
    authorized by the Legislature and identify how the debt will be
    paid.</li> </ul> <b>Assumptions by Section</b><br> <ul>
    <li>Section 2 limits expenditures from the Motor Vehicle Fund and
    toll funds to transportation purposes.</li> <li>Section 3
    prohibits the state and its agencies from the transfer or use of
    gas tax or toll-funded lanes for non-highway purposes.</li>
    <li>Section 4 applies to all tolled facilities, except the Tacoma
    Narrows Bridge and state ferries. The Legislature shall determine
    and establish tolls and charges on tolled facilities. The
    initiative does not change existing tolls, toll rates or
    methodologies. However, to impose a new toll, increase a toll or
    change a toll methodology to increase revenue, the Legislature
    must act. In addition, toll revenue must be used for the facility
    in which the funds are generated and only for highway
    purposes.</li> <li>Sections 5 through 7 apply to toll bridges and
    other state toll facilities, excluding state ferries, first
    authorized after July 1, 2008. The Legislature is the tolling
    authority for all state highways. The initiative does not change
    existing tolls, toll rates or methodologies. However, to impose a
    new toll, increase a toll or change a toll methodology to increase
    revenue, the Legislature must act. In addition, for the future:
    <ul> <li>Toll revenue must be used for the facility in which the
    funds are generated;</li> <li>Toll revenue must be used only for
    highway purposes;</li> <li>Toll rates must be uniform and
    consistent and may not include variable pricing; and</li>
    <li>Tolls on future tolled facilities must end after the cost of
    the project is paid.</li> </ul> </li> <li>Section 8 applies only
    to tolls on the Interstate 90 floating bridge. Toll revenue from
    this facility must be used exclusively for toll facilities and
    capital improvements on Interstate 90 and only for highway
    purposes.</li> </ul> &nbsp;<br> <b>State and Local Fiscal
    Impacts</b><br> Section 2. No fiscal impact is assumed from this
    section. Expenditures from the Motor Vehicle Fund and toll funds
    are restricted by law to transportation purposes.<br> &nbsp;<br>
    Section 3. This restriction is assumed to have no impact on state
    or local revenues. The restriction also does not direct new
    expenditures or new costs. Therefore, it is assumed that state and
    local governments will adjust their actions to comply with this
    restriction, resulting in no new increased or decreased costs.<br>
    &nbsp;<br> Sections 4 through 8 are described by tolled
    facility:<br> &nbsp;<br> Tacoma Narrows Bridge<br> These sections
    do not apply to this bridge, and therefore, no fiscal impact is
    assumed.<br> &nbsp;<br> State Route 167 High-Occupancy Vehicle
    Lanes<br> Because these tolled lanes were first authorized before
    July 1, 2008, only Section 4 applies to them. Tolls are authorized
    for this facility until June 30, 2013. It is not anticipated that
    toll rates will increase during this authorization. Therefore, no
    fiscal impact is assumed on toll revenues from the lanes. There is
    no debt on these lanes.<br> &nbsp;<br> Tolls collected from
    high-occupancy toll lanes can be used to increase transit,
    vanpool, carpool and trip reduction services in the State Route
    167 corridor, which could be inconsistent with highway
    purposes. However, enacted budgets provide that all tolls
    collected from the lanes be used solely for the operation,
    administration and enforcement of these lanes. Therefore, no
    fiscal impact is assumed for state and local expenditures.<br>
    &nbsp;<br> State Route 520 Bridge<br> Sections 4 though 7 apply to
    this bridge. Tolls are authorized and have been set for this
    bridge. The Legislature has identified toll revenue as part of the
    State Route 520 bridge replacement and high-occupancy vehicle
    program. It is not known whether a toll rate increase will be
    necessary during the period covered by this fiscal impact
    statement. However, if it is necessary, the Legislature will need
    to act to set tolls subject to requirements contained in Section
    7.<br> &nbsp;<br> Current law requires the use of variable
    tolling. If a toll rate increase is necessary, a new toll rate
    analysis and supplemental environmental review will be required to
    implement a uniform and consistent toll rate. Assuming that these
    analyses can be conducted concurrently within project schedules,
    the cost is estimated at up to $3.2 million. Prior analysis
    indicates that a fixed toll rate equivalent to the weighted
    average of variable tolls could reduce revenue by up to 11 percent
    due to different traffic patterns (Parsons Brinckerhoff analysis,
    March 2008). However, because a new analysis is necessary to
    quantify impacts and it is not certain that a toll rate increase
    is necessary during the period covered by the fiscal impact
    statement, the impact on toll revenue is indeterminate.<br>
    &nbsp;<br> Federal Urban Partnership Agreement (UPA) grants were
    awarded to the Washington State Department of Transportation, King
    County and King County Ferry District conditioned on implementing
    variable tolling on the existing State Route 520 bridge. If a toll
    rate increase is necessary and variable tolling is prohibited, the
    state, King County and King County Ferry District would lose
    authority to spend remaining grant funds and could be required to
    repay the entire grant amount. The state has spent $64.4 million
    of the state&rsquo;s $86.1 million UPA grant, leaving $21.7
    million remaining as of July 2011. King County has spent $34.8
    million of the county&rsquo;s $41 million UPA grant, leaving $6.2
    million remaining as of July 2011. The King County Ferry District
    was awarded $1 million, none of which has been spent as of July
    2011. Because it is not known if a toll rate increase is necessary
    during the period covered by the fiscal impact statement or what
    action the federal government will take, the impact on this grant
    revenue is indeterminate.<br> &nbsp;<br> Tolls collected from
    State Route 520 can be used to provide for the operations of
    conveyances of people or goods, which could be inconsistent with
    highway purposes. However, current law and enacted budgets provide
    that tolls collected from State Route 520 must be used for
    operation and administration of the tolled bridge and
    high-occupancy vehicle program and to repay bond obligations used
    to finance construction and capital improvement costs, which are
    assumed to be consistent with highway purposes. Therefore, no
    fiscal impact is assumed on state and local government
    expenditures during the period covered by the fiscal impact
    statement.<br> &nbsp;<br> Current law authorizes the issuance of
    $1.95 billion in bonds secured solely by toll revenue or secured
    by both toll and gas tax revenue. The State Treasurer states that
    requiring tolls to be set and adjusted by the Legislature rather
    than by an independent toll-setting body would make the cost of
    bonds secured solely by toll revenue prohibitively expensive and
    would be unprecedented nationally. Because investors in toll
    revenue bonds see the independence of toll-setting bodies as a
    critical credit characteristic, no other toll revenue bond issuer
    in the nation sets tolls subject to legislative approval (Public
    Resource Advisory Group analysis, Feb. 8, 2011). Therefore, the
    State Treasurer states that bonds secured solely by toll revenue
    would be eliminated as a financing tool for the bridge. Gas tax or
    other revenues would be necessary to issue bonds, reducing overall
    capacity to finance transportation projects, which may impact
    future expenditures.<br> &nbsp;<br> Interstate 405 High-Occupancy
    Vehicle Lanes<br> Sections 4 though 7 apply to these lanes. Tolls
    are authorized for these lanes, but tolls have not been
    set. Current law requires the use of dynamic tolling. To implement
    a uniform and consistent toll rate, a new toll rate analysis and
    supplemental environmental review would be required. Assuming that
    these analyses can be conducted concurrently within project
    schedules, the cost is estimated at up to $2.5 million. Because
    the new analysis is necessary to quantify impacts, the impact on
    toll revenue is indeterminate.<br> &nbsp;<br> Tolls collected from
    Interstate 405 high-occupancy vehicle lanes can be used to provide
    for the operations of conveyances of people or goods, which could
    be inconsistent with the highway purposes. However, current law
    and enacted budgets provide that tolls collected from the lanes
    must be used for operation and administration of the tolled lanes
    and to repay bond obligations to finance construction and capital
    improvement costs, which are assumed to be consistent with the
    highway purposes. Therefore, no fiscal impact is assumed on state
    and local government expenditures during the period covered by the
    fiscal impact statement.<br> &nbsp;<br> Current bond
    authorizations for construction and capital improvements of
    Interstate 405 high-occupancy vehicle lanes from Bellevue to
    Lynnwood are secured by gas tax revenue. Therefore, no fiscal
    impact is assumed on indebtedness for these lanes.<br> &nbsp;<br>
    State Route 99 Alaskan Way Viaduct<br> Sections 4 though 7 apply
    to this highway. Tolls have not been authorized by the
    Legislature. Current toll rate analysis for this highway has
    assumed the use of variable pricing. To implement a uniform and
    consistent rate, a new toll rate analysis and supplemental
    environmental review would be required. Assuming that these
    analyses can be conducted concurrently within project schedules,
    the cost is estimated at up to $2.6 million. Because tolls have
    not been authorized and the new analysis is necessary to quantify
    impacts, the impact to toll revenue is indeterminate.<br>
    &nbsp;<br> The Legislature has identified toll revenue as part of
    the State Route 99 Alaskan Way Viaduct replacement project. This
    expenditure is assumed to be consistent with the highway
    purposes. Therefore, no fiscal impact is assumed on state and
    local expenditures.<br> &nbsp;<br> Current bond authorizations for
    construction and capital improvements for portions of the State
    Route 99 Alaskan Way Viaduct replacement project are secured by
    gas tax revenue. If costs exceed $2.4 billion, no more than $400
    million of additional costs will be financed with toll
    revenue. Because there is no authorization to use toll revenue for
    bonds, the fiscal impact on indebtedness for this highway is
    indeterminate. Additionally, the State Treasurer states that bonds
    secured solely by toll revenue would be eliminated as a financing
    tool for this highway.<br> &nbsp;<br> Interstate 90 Floating
    Bridge<br> Sections 4 though 8 will apply to this bridge. Whether
    the Legislature will authorize tolls on the Interstate 90 floating
    bridge and for what purpose are unknown. Therefore, the fiscal
    impact is unknown and indeterminate. Additionally, State Treasurer
    states that bonds secured solely by toll revenue would be
    eliminated as a financing tool for this highway.<br> &nbsp;<br>
    Future Facilities<br> Sections 4 though 7 will apply to future
    tolled facilities. The Washington State Department of
    Transportation was directed by the Legislature to conduct tolling
    analysis on the Interstate 5 Columbia River Crossing in Clark
    County, Interstate 5 express lanes between Seattle and Northgate,
    Interstate 90 in King County, Interstate 405 high-occupancy
    vehicle lanes from Bellevue south, State Route 509 in King County
    and State Route 167 extension in Pierce County. Whether the
    Legislature will authorize tolling on these highways and for what
    purpose are unknown. Therefore, the fiscal impact is unknown and
    indeterminate. Additionally, the State Treasurer states that bonds
    secured solely by toll revenue would be eliminated as a financing
    tool for these bridges and highways.'  )

  :long_description => '<b>The Law as it Presently Exists</b><br>
    Long-term care workers assist the elderly and persons with
    disabilities in the homes of the people they assist or through
    assisted living facilities, adult family homes, or state-licensed
    boarding homes. Assistance by long-term care workers may include
    help with eating, dressing, bathing, meal preparation, household
    chores, and other assistance with daily life. Long-term care
    workers might provide this assistance under a direct contract with
    the state as an individual provider, or they might be employees of
    home care agencies or other facilities. Long-term care workers
    include respite care providers, community residential service
    providers, and any other worker who directly provides home or
    community-based services to the elderly or persons with functional
    or developmental disabilities. Long-term care workers do not
    include employees of nursing homes, hospitals or other acute care
    facilities, adult day care centers, or adult day health
    providers. Long-term care workers are paid according to a
    collective bargaining agreement negotiated with the state, subject
    to legislative approval.<br> &nbsp;<br> State law currently
    requires that long-term care workers receive training. Additional
    requirements are scheduled to take effect in the future. Under
    current law, long-term care workers hired on or after January 1,
    2014, will be required to be certified by the state Department of
    Health as &ldquo;home care aides&rdquo; within 150 days of
    beginning work. To be certified, long-term care workers will need
    to complete specific training and pass an examination. The
    requirement that long-term care workers receive 35 hours of basic
    training will increase to a 75-hour requirement on January 1,
    2014. State law requires that the state pay for the training, and
    pay long-term care workers for the time they spend in
    training. After they are certified, long-term care workers hired
    after January 1, 2014, will be required to receive 12 hours of
    continuing training each year. There are reduced requirements for
    those who only provide care for their own adult children or
    parents. The state will also be required to offer advanced
    training to long-term care workers beginning January 1, 2014.<br>
    &nbsp;<br> State law also requires that long-term care workers
    receive criminal background checks. These checks determine whether
    long-term care workers have a criminal history that would
    disqualify them from working with vulnerable persons. These checks
    currently look only for criminal convictions in Washington. If the
    worker has lived in Washington less than three years, then a
    fingerprint-based check also is conducted through the Federal
    Bureau of Investigation (FBI). All long-term care workers hired
    after January 1, 2014, will be required to receive a
    fingerprint-based check through the FBI, no matter how long they
    have lived in Washington.<br> &nbsp;<br> <b>The Effect of the
    Proposed Measure, if Approved</b><br> Initiative Measure 1163
    would move up the date by which the additional training,
    certification, and background check requirements for long-term
    care workers take effect. The requirement that long-term care
    workers receive certification as &ldquo;home care aides,&rdquo;
    and receive additional training would apply to all long-term care
    workers hired on or after January 7, 2012, instead of January 1,
    2014. The requirement that long-term care workers receive criminal
    background checks through the FBI would apply to all long-term
    care workers hired on or after January 1, 2012, instead of January
    1, 2014. Community residential service providers would not be
    covered by these additional training, certification, and
    background check requirements until January 1, 2016. <br>
    &nbsp;<br> In addition, this measure would require that the state
    auditor conduct performance audits of the state&rsquo;s long-term
    in-home care program. The first audit would have to be completed
    within twelve months after this measure takes effect. The auditor
    would be required to conduct performance audits &ldquo;on a
    biannual basis thereafter.&rdquo; This measure would also require
    the state to hire five additional fraud investigators.<br>
    &nbsp;<br> This measure would require the state to limit its
    administrative expenses so that at least 90% of taxpayer spending
    on the long-term in-home care program is devoted to direct
    care. The state would be required to achieve this limitation
    within two years after this measure takes effect. This measure
    also provides that if the passage of this act triggers changes to
    any collective bargaining agreement, then those changes go into
    effect immediately without the need for legislative approval.<p>',
  :additional_details => '<p>Current law requires increased
    mandatory training, background checks and certification for
    long-term care workers, depending on worker classification,
    beginning Jan. 1, 2014. Initiative 1163 would require the
    training, background checks and certification for long-term care
    workers to begin Jan. 7, 2012, but delay these requirements for
    community residential providers until Jan 1, 2016. For the
    long-term in-home care program, administrative costs are capped
    and performance audits with additional fraud investigators are
    required. Over six fiscal years, costs are estimated to increase
    $31.3 million and revenue from the federal government and fees is
    estimated to increase $18.4 million.</p> <p> <b>General
    Assumptions</b> <br> The Washington State Office of Financial
    Management, in consultation with the Washington State Department
    of Social and Health Services (DSHS) and Department of Health
    (DOH), developed a model to estimate the costs and expenditures of
    implementing increased mandatory training, background checks and
    certification for long-term care workers. This model was first
    developed for the fiscal impact statement for Initiative 1029,
    passed in 2008, and subsequently used for fiscal notes on
    legislation, including Engrossed Substitute Senate Bill 6180
    (2009) and Engrossed Substitute House Bill 1548 (2011). This
    statement uses this model updated to the June 2011 Caseload
    Forecast Council forecast (forecast).</p> <p> The following
    assumptions are used to measure fiscal impacts: <ul> <li>Estimates
    are described using the state&#39;s fiscal year (FY) of July 1
    through June 30.</li> <li>The initiative applies prospectively
    with an implementation date of Jan. 7, 2012.</li> <li>Current law
    directs that increased mandatory training, background checks and
    certification for long-term care workers begin Jan. 1, 2014. The
    initiative would require training, background checks and
    certifications to begin Jan. 7, 2012, but delay the requirements
    for workers who are community residential service providers to
    Jan. 1, 2016. Revenues, expenditures and costs already assumed to
    begin Jan. 1, 2014, are netted against revenues, expenditures and
    costs generated from the initiative.</li> <li>Increased mandatory
    training, background checks and certification requirements vary by
    type of long-term care worker: <ul> <li>Beginning Jan. 7, 2012,
    workers who care for the elderly or persons with disabilities are
    required to complete 75 hours of mandatory training (up from 35
    hours), background checks and certification. The training includes
    five hours of basic safety information and orientation that must
    be completed before the worker begins employment. The remaining 70
    hours must be completed within 120 days of the worker being hired
    and can include 12 hours of structured peer mentoring.</li>
    <li>Beginning Jan. 7, 2012, workers hired as individual providers
    who care for their own elderly or disabled parent or child, or
    individual providers who work 20 hours or less per month are
    required to complete increased mandatory training (the amount
    varies), background checks and certification requirements.</li>
    <li>Beginning Jan. 1, 2016, workers who are community residential
    providers (supported living providers) are required to complete 75
    hours of mandatory training (up from 35 hours), and background
    checks, but do not require certification.</li> <li>All workers are
    required to complete 12 hours of continuing education courses each
    year to maintain certification. DSHS must offer, but not require,
    advanced training to long-term care workers.</li> </ul> <li>The
    number of workers who would receive training was developed using
    the June 2011 Caseload Forecast Council estimate of the number of
    long-term care clients.</li> <li>Current wage information was used
    as the basis for wage costs, with no inflationary increases
    included.</li> <li>The initiative does not trigger changes to the
    collective bargaining agreement reached between the state and the
    exclusive bargaining representative of long-term care
    workers. Therefore, no fiscal impact is assumed.</li> <li>No
    revenue, cost, expenditure or indebtedness impacts are assumed for
    local governments.</li> <li>There is no state debt associated with
    long-term care worker training and background check
    requirements. Therefore, state fiscal impacts are limited to
    revenues, costs and expenditures.</li> </ul> </p> <p> <b>State

  :long_description => '<b>The Law as it Presently Exists</b><br> In
    Washington, the state sells and controls the distribution and sale
    of &ldquo;spirits.&rdquo; The term &ldquo;spirits&rdquo; refers to
    alcoholic beverages also called &ldquo;hard liquor&rdquo;
    (whiskies, vodka, gin, etc.). Spirits include beverages containing
    distilled alcohol and wines exceeding twenty-four percent alcohol
    by volume. Spirits do not include lower alcohol content beverages
    such as flavored malt beverages, beer, or wines containing less
    than twenty-four percent alcohol by volume.<br> &nbsp;<br> In
    Washington, spirits are sold at retail at state-run liquor stores
    and at &ldquo;contract liquor stores.&rdquo; Contract liquor
    stores are private businesses that sell spirits and other liquor
    under a contract with the state. Washington has approximately 165
    state liquor stores and 160 contract liquor stores.<br> &nbsp;<br>
    The Washington State Liquor Control Board (&ldquo;the
    Board&rdquo;) operates the state liquor stores and oversees the
    contract liquor stores. Among its responsibilities, the Board
    regulates liquor advertising in the state. The Board, however,
    cannot advertise liquor sales.<br> &nbsp;<br> The Board sets the
    price for spirits sold at state-run and contract liquor stores
    based on the wholesale cost of the spirits, taxes, and a markup
    authorized by statute. The Board also collects the taxes imposed
    on the retail sale of spirits, and collects license fees and
    penalties. The proceeds received from the sale of spirits, the tax
    revenues on spirits, and license fees are distributed to cities,
    counties, and the state. Certain revenues are dedicated to funding
    programs addressing alcohol and drug abuse treatment and
    prevention.<br> &nbsp;<br> In Washington, manufacturers and
    suppliers of spirits may only sell spirits to the Board. The Board
    acts as the sole distributor of spirits sold in the state liquor
    stores and contract liquor stores, and sold by restaurants and
    certain other licensed sellers. Under a law effective June 15,
    2011, the state must examine whether to lease the state&rsquo;s
    liquor distribution facilities to a private party, and whether
    such a lease would produce better financial returns for the
    state.<br> &nbsp;<br> Existing law allows private parties to sell
    or distribute alcoholic beverages that are not spirits, such as
    wine or beer. Wine and beer sellers are licensed by the
    state. There are different licenses for each of &ldquo;three
    tiers&rdquo; of the wine and beer business: (1) manufacturing; (2)
    distribution; and (3) retail sales. Existing law regulates the
    financial relationships and business transactions allowed between
    manufacturers, distributors, and retailers. While there are some
    exceptions, retailers are allowed to purchase wine or beer only
    from distributors. Similarly, distributors are allowed to purchase
    only from manufacturers, with certain exceptions.<br> &nbsp;<br>
    Existing law requires wine and beer manufacturers and distributors
    to maintain published price lists and offer the same price to
    every buyer. This requirement of uniform pricing prevents
    manufacturers or distributors from selling wine or beer at
    discounted prices to select customers, such as a quantity discount
    or other business reason for a discount. Existing law also
    requires wine and beer retailers to receive all wine and beer at
    their retail store and to not take delivery or store wine or beer
    at a separate warehouse location.<br> &nbsp;<br> <b>The Effect of
    the Proposed Measure, if Approved</b><br> Initiative 1183 allows
    private parties to sell and distribute spirits, and alters the
    Liquor Control Board&rsquo;s powers and duties. It eliminates the
    Board&rsquo;s power to operate state liquor stores, to supervise
    the contract liquor stores, to distribute liquor, and to set the
    prices of spirits. Initiative 1183 directs the Board to close
    state liquor stores by June 1, 2012. It directs the Board to sell
    assets connected with liquor sales and distribution, and to sell
    at auction the right to operate a private liquor store at the
    location of any existing state liquor store. Initiative 1183
    repeals a 2011 law that directed the state to examine the
    financial benefit of leasing the state liquor distribution
    facilities to a private party.<br> &nbsp;<br> Under Initiative
    1183, qualifying private parties may obtain licenses to distribute
    spirits or to sell spirits at retail. A retail spirits license
    allows the retailer to sell spirits directly to consumers, and
    allows the sale of up to 24 liters of spirits for resale at a
    licensed premise, such as to a restaurant. Initiative 1183 allows
    private distributors to start selling spirits on March 1, 2012,
    and private retail spirits sales to start on June 1, 2012.<br>
    &nbsp;<br> To obtain a retail spirits license, a store must have
    at least 10,000 square feet of enclosed retail space in a single
    structure. However, Initiative 1183 also allows a retail spirits
    license for a store at the location of a former state liquor store
    or contract liquor store, even if the store is smaller than 10,000
    square feet. It also allows smaller stores where there are no
    10,000 square foot licensed spirits stores in the area. Initiative
    1183 requires retail stores to participate in training their
    employees to prevent sales of alcohol to minors and inebriated
    persons.<br> &nbsp;<br> Initiative 1183 allows local governments
    and the public to provide input before issuance of a license to
    sell spirits. Initiative 1183 preserves local government power to
    zone and regulate the location of liquor stores.<br> &nbsp;<br>
    Initiative 1183 would not change the existing taxes on
    spirits. Initiative 1183 would require spirits retailers and
    distributors to pay license fees to the state. Retail stores would
    pay a fee of seventeen percent of gross revenues from spirits
    sales under the license, plus an annual $166 fee. Spirits
    distributors would pay an annual $1,320 fee, plus a percentage of
    gross revenues from spirits sales under the license. During the
    first two years of a spirits distributor license, the distributor
    license fee would be ten percent of the distributor&rsquo;s gross
    spirits sales. After two years, the spirits distributor fee would
    drop to five percent of the distributor&rsquo;s gross spirits
    sales.<br> &nbsp;<br> Initiative 1183 also requires that all
    persons holding spirits distributor licenses must have together
    paid a total of one hundred fifty million dollars in spirits
    distributor license fees by March 31, 2013. If the total license
    fees received from all distributor license holders is less than
    one hundred fifty million dollars, the Board must collect
    additional spirits distributor license fees to make up the
    difference. This additional fee would be allocated among the
    persons who held a spirits distributor license at any time before
    March 31, 2013.<br> &nbsp;<br> In addition to existing laws
    controlling the distribution of moneys received by the Board, a
    portion of fees from retail spirits licenses and spirits
    distributor licenses would be distributed to border areas,
    counties, and cities to enhance public safety programs.<br>
    &nbsp;<br> Initiative 1183 also changes laws that regulate the
    retailers, distributors, and manufacturers of wine. Initiative
    1183 eliminates the requirement that distributors and
    manufacturers of wine sell at a uniform price, which would allow
    the sale of wine at different prices based on business
    reasons. Spirits could also be sold to different distributors and
    retailers at different prices. Beer manufacturers and
    distributors, however, would continue to be regulated by existing
    laws requiring uniform pricing. Under Initiative 1183, retailers
    could accept delivery of wine at a retail store or at a warehouse
    location. Under Initiative 1183, a store licensed to sell wine at
    retail may also obtain an endorsement allowing the store to sell
    to license holders who sell wine for consumption on the
    premise. For example, this would allow the store to sell wine to a
    restaurant that resells the wine by the glass or bottle to its
    customers.<p>',
  :additional_details => ' <p>The fiscal impact cannot be precisely
    estimated because the private market will determine bottle cost
    and markup for spirits.&nbsp;Using a range of assumptions, total
    State General Fund revenues increase an estimated $216 million to
    $253 million and total local revenues increase an estimated $186
    million to $227 million, after Liquor Control Board one-time and
    ongoing expenses, over six fiscal years.&nbsp;A one-time net state
    revenue gain of $28.4 million is estimated from sale of the state
    liquor distribution center. One-time debt service costs are $5.3
    million. Ongoing new state costs are estimated at $158,600 over
    six fiscal years.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p><b>General
    Assumptions</b></p> <ul> <li>The initiative uses the term
    &#39;spirits&#39; to describe alcoholic beverages that are
    distilled instead of fermented. For purposes of the fiscal impact
    statement, the term &#39;liquor&#39; is used for &#39;spirits&#39;
    to maintain consistent terminology. Beer and wine are not spirits
    or liquor.</li> <li>Estimates are described using the state&#39;s
    fiscal year (FY) of July 1 through June 30.</li> <li>New liquor
    distributor licenses and new liquor retailer licenses are
    available beginning Feb. 8, 2012. There is no limit on the number
    of licenses that can be issued.&nbsp;</li> <li>Liquor distributor
    licensees can begin making sales of liquor March 1, 2012. Liquor
    retailer licensees can begin making sales of liquor June 1,
    2012.</li> <li>By June 15, 2012, the state will no longer operate
    the state liquor distribution center or state liquor stores.</li>
    <li>Estimates assume 1,428 licensed liquor retailers based on
    research from implementation of Substitute Senate Bill 6329 that
    authorized beer and wine tasting at grocery stores with a fully
    enclosed retail area of 9,000 square feet and the current number
    of state-operated and contract-operated liquor stores (328). The
    number of licenses is assumed to be constant for each fiscal
    year.&nbsp;</li> <li>Estimates assume 184 licensed liquor
    distributors, based on the number of current Washington State
    Liquor Control Board (LCB) licensed beer and wine distributors,
    wine distributors, distilleries and liquor importers. The number
    of licenses is assumed to be constant for each fiscal
    year.&nbsp;</li> <li>Estimates of impacts are measured against the
    June 2011 LCB revenue forecast (forecast).</li> <li>Retail liquor
    liter sales are estimated to grow 5 percent from increased access
    to liquor. This assumption is based on an academic study and
    growth experienced in Alberta, Canada, after converting from
    state-operated liquor stores to private liquor stores. A decrease
    in liquor liter sales is estimated using the forecast price
    elasticity assumption of 0.49 percent. Price elasticity is a
    method used to calculate the change in consumption of a good when
    price increases or decreases. For every 1 percent
    increase/decrease in price, liquor liter sales increase/decrease
    0.49 percent. Growth from increased access and price elasticity is
    in addition to normal 3 percent growth in liquor liter sales
    assumed in the forecast.</li> </ul> <p><b>State and Local
    Revenues</b></p> <p>Actual fiscal impacts depend on liquor bottle
    cost in the private market and the markup applied by both private
    liquor distributors and retailers. Therefore, there is a wide
    range of potential fiscal impacts.&nbsp;</p> <p>To estimate gains
    or losses to the state and local governments, the fiscal impact
    statement used a model developed for prior initiatives, adjusted
    to reflect the content of this initiative. The model measures the
    difference between LCB forecasted liquor revenues and the sum of
    the revenue gains and losses generated under the initiative using
    the set of assumptions set forth below.</p> <p><b>Total Estimated

    imposes a new liquor distributor license fee of 10 percent of
    total liquor revenues from March 1, 2012, to March 1, 2014; the
    fee decreases to 5 percent thereafter. The initiative imposes a
    new liquor retailer license fee of 17 percent of total liquor
    revenues beginning June 1, 2012.</li> <li>Based on inventory
    information from the Retail Owners Institute, private liquor
    stores are estimated to maintain two months of liquor
    inventory. In contrast, state-operated liquor stores maintain 1.2
    months of liquor inventory. Therefore, an additional 0.8 month of
    liquor liter sales to liquor <span class=GramE>retailers is
    assumed during FY 2012.&nbsp;</li> <li>If the new liquor
    distributor license fee totals less than $150 million by March 31,
    2013, these licensees must pay the difference between $150 million
    and actual receipts by May 31, 2013. The model estimates that $84
    million to $91 million will be paid by licensees during FY 2013
    due to this requirement.</li> <li>The initiative sets a $1,320
    license fee for each liquor distribution location and a $166
    license fee for each liquor retailer license. Both fees are due at
    the time of license renewal.&nbsp;</li> <li>Liquor distributor
    licensees are assumed to be subject to the wholesaling business
    and occupation (B&amp;O) tax. Liquor retailer licensees are
    assumed to be subject to the retailing B&amp;O tax.&nbsp;</li>
    <li>Liquor liter taxes and liquor sales taxes are amended by the
    initiative, but these changes are assumed not to increase, create
    or eliminate any tax.</li> <li>Except for the loss of sales in
    state-operated liquor stores, estimates do not assume any change
    in pricing or volume of sales of beer and wine.</li>
    <li>State-operated liquor stores sell Washington State Lottery
    products to the public. The estimate assumes 25 percent of these
    sales will be lost and remaining sales will occur in other outlets
    selling Washington State Lottery products. This revenue loss is
    estimated to be $1.8 million over six years.</li> <li>Estimates of
    sales by current restaurant licensees who sell liquor at retail
    are limited to changes from price elasticity and the loss of the
    state&#39;s 15 percent quantity price discount to these
    licensees.</li> <li>Estimates do not assume any change in sales by
    liquor stores operated on military bases. Such sales are assumed
    not to be subject to liquor liter taxes, liquor sales taxes or
    B&amp;O tax.</li> <li>Estimates do not assume any change in sales
    by liquor stores operated by tribes. Such sales are assumed to be
    subject to liquor liter taxes and liquor sales taxes based on
    current agreements between tribes and LCB, but are not subject to
    B&amp;O tax.</li> <li>No additional change is assumed for tax
    avoidance/non-compliance by consumers or migration of sales in and
    out of state by consumers. These items are assumed in the forecast
    price elasticity assumption.</li> <li>Revenue from the state
    markup used to pay for the state liquor distribution center and
    state liquor store costs are netted to zero. The initiative
    eliminates both the revenue (markup) and the costs (state liquor
    distribution center and state liquor stores), which results in no
    additional revenue to the state.&nbsp;</li> <li>The initiative
    requires new liquor distributor and retailer fees to be deposited
    into the Liquor Revolving Fund. The Liquor Revolving Fund is
    distributed by statute in the following order: <ol> <li>Payment of
    LCB administrative costs;</li> <li>Distributions to state accounts
    for specific purposes (such as drug and alcohol research at the
    University of Washington and Washington State University);</li>
    <li>Border areas (cities, towns and counties adjacent to the
    Canadian border); and</li> <li>The remainder after these
    distributions: a) 50 percent to the State General Fund; b) 10
    percent to counties; and 3) 40 percent to cities and towns. </li>
    </ol> </li> </ul> <p>Therefore, the model first reduces the Liquor
    Revolving Fund by LCB costs, one-time and ongoing, to determine
    total revenues distributed to the State General Fund and local
    governments. Other revenues (beer taxes, wine taxes, penalties,
    etc.)  deposited into the Liquor Revolving Fund are assumed to be
    unaffected by the initiative and continue to be shared between the
    state and local governments.</p> <p><b>Specific Local Government
    Revenue Assumptions</b></p> <ul> <li>New liquor distributor and
    retailers license fees must be used to maintain, in the aggregate,
    Liquor Revolving Fund distributions to counties, cities, towns,
    border areas and the Municipal Research Service Center in an
    amount no less than the amount received in comparable periods. For
    purposes of the model, comparable period is measured by funds
    forecasted for calendar year 2011. The model estimates that local
    distributions will exceed the maintenance level required by the
    initiative each fiscal year.&nbsp;</li> <li>An additional $10
    million is also provided to counties, cities, towns and border
    areas.&nbsp;</li> <li>Approximately 38 cities and towns impose a
    local B&amp;O tax. Using data from the Washington State Department
    of Revenue&#39;s 2008 Tax Reference Manual, total local B&amp;O
    tax is approximately 10 percent of total state B&amp;O
    tax. Assuming this ratio, $3 million is estimated as new local
    B&amp;O taxes from liquor sales over six fiscal years.</li>
    <li>Total local government revenues are the sum of the increased
    Liquor Revolving Fund distributions, the additional $10 million
    and local B&amp;O tax.</li> </ul> <p><b>Specific State Asset
    Assumptions</b></p> <p>The sale of the state liquor distribution
    center is estimated to generate a potential net $28.4 million in
    revenue. Because the sale date cannot be precisely determined,
    this revenue is stated separately and excluded from the total
    State General Fund revenue estimates in the first table above. The
    value of the state liquor distribution center is estimated to be
    $20.4 million, based on the King County Assessor&#39;s Office 2011
    assessed value of the property. The sale of the equipment in the
    state liquor distribution center is estimated to be $8 million,
    based on the 2010 Washington State Auditor review, which assumed
    the sale of $16 million in assets would return about $8
    million. Costs to sell the state liquor distribution center are
    estimated to total $1 million at the time of sale.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>The initiative requires LCB to sell by public auction the right
    &#8212; at each state-owned store location &#8212; to operate a
    liquor store upon the premises without regard to the size of the
    premises if the applicant otherwise qualifies for a liquor
    retailer license. All state-operated liquor stores are leased and
    cannot be transferred or assigned. In addition, of the 166
    state-operated liquor stores, 127 are located within one block of
    a grocery store. Because these factors (location, competition and
    lessor) will vary by state-operated liquor store and will affect
    the value of each operating right, revenue generated from the
    auction is indeterminate and not assumed in the model.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>The initiative would repeal Engrossed Substitute Senate Bill
    5942 (ESSB 5942), which directed the Office of Financial
    Management to conduct a competitive process for the selection of a
    private sector entity to lease and modernize the state&#39;s
    liquor warehousing and distribution facilities. Under ESSB 5942,
    if a proposal is determined to be in the best interests of the
    state by the Office of Financial Management after consultation
    with LCB and an advisory board created through the legislation,
    LCB may contract with that private entity for the lease of the
    state&#39;s liquor warehousing and distribution
    facilities. Because it is not known if LCB will enter into a
    contract, no revenue is assumed in the model.</p> <p><b>State and
    Local Expenditure Estimate Assumptions</b></p> <p>Revenue gains
    will accrue to existing accounts, the largest being the State
    General Fund, which may be used for any governmental purpose as
    appropriated by the Legislature.</p> <p>Washington State Lottery
    proceeds in excess of expenses are deposited into the State
    Opportunity Pathways Account to support programs in higher
    education and early learning. Due to the loss of some lottery
    product sales in state liquor stores, it is estimated that funds
    to this account will decrease $1.8 million over six fiscal
    years.</p> <p>Each county and city is required to spend 2 percent
    of its share of liquor revenues on alcohol and chemical dependency
    services, and these expenditures will increase. The additional $10
    million distributed to cities, towns, counties and border areas
    are for enhancing public safety programs. The remaining revenue
    can be used for any allowable local government purpose.</p>
    <p><b>State and Local Cost Estimate Assumptions</b></p> <p>The
    fiscal impact statement does not estimate state costs or state
    savings due to social impacts from approval of the initiative. No
    costs are assumed for local governments.</p> <p><b>Liquor Control
    Board Costs</b></p> <p>Estimated one-time and ongoing LCB costs
    are assumed to be paid by the Liquor Revolving Fund.&nbsp;
    Therefore, payment of the following costs is reflected in the
    State General Fund revenue estimate.</p> <p>LCB ongoing costs for
    licensing, enforcement and administration are estimated to
    increase by $350,000 for new fee-collection costs and implementing
    the &#39;responsible vendor program.&#39;&nbsp; No state costs
    from increased enforcement activities are assumed in the
    estimate.</p> <p>Assuming a closure date of June 15, 2012, LCB
    will incur one-time state costs associated with managing the
    closure of the state liquor distribution center and state liquor
    stores. There will be additional one-time costs for issuing new
    licenses. These state costs are estimated to total $28.7 million
    during FYs 2012 and 2013:</p> <ul> <li>Unemployment, sick leave
    and vacation buyout costs for state employees estimated at $11.8
    million.</li> <li>Information technology changes and staff to
    issue new licenses estimated at $2.7 million.</li> <li>Staffing
    costs to coordinate the sale of existing inventory, termination of
    contract store leases, surplus of store fixtures and auction of
    state-operated store operating rights estimated at $11
    million.</li> <li>Final audits of each state and contract liquor
    store estimated at $1.9 million.</li> <li>Project management and
    additional human resource staff estimated at $1.3 million.</li>
    </ul> <p><b>Department of Revenue Costs</b></p> <p>The Washington
    State Department of Revenue will administer the collection of
    liquor excise tax from licensed liquor distributors and
    retailers. Costs include additional staff, information technology
    changes, rule-making and policy activities, taxpayer mailings and
    workshops, supplies and materials. Total one-time state costs are
    estimated to total $120,100 during FY 2012. Ongoing costs are
    estimated to be $38,500 each fiscal year beginning FY
    2013.&nbsp;</p> <p><b>State Indebtedness</b></p> <p>There is $5.3
    million in debt service costs for a Certificate of Participation
    bond for the state liquor distribution center that is scheduled to
    be paid by Dec. 1, 2013. This one-time state cost is assumed in FY
    2014.</p> ' )
