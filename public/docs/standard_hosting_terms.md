A complete response may first require Customer to provide additional information. Some Service Levels provide a Support Request Response Commitment to respond within a certain number of days, as well as an escalation path.

_Resolve Customer Support Requests_. A Customer Support Request is resolved when Consider.it LLC determines that the underlying issue has been resolved, or that the request falls outside the scope of the Service Plan.

The following are the available Service Levels that Consider.it LLC may agree to. The Service Level is Service Level 0, unless superseded by a different contract or specified by the Service Plan.
