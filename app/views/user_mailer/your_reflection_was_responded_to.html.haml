      Hi #{@user.name},
    
    %p
      #{@comment.user.name} responded to your summary of their comment. They  
      - if @response.signal == 1
        did not feel the summary was completely accurate, and #{@comment.user.first_name} clarified their original point: 
        %blockquote
          #{@response.text}
      - elsif @response.signal == 2
        verified that you heard them accurately.
      - elsif @response.signal == 0
        do not believe that your point was a summary of what they said.
      
    %p 
      Go
      %a{ :href => "#{proposal_url(@comment.root_object.proposal)}" }
        here
      to continue the conversation.

    %p
      Thanks!
