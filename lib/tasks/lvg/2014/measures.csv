Should this measure be enacted into law?</p>","<p><span style=""font-size: 10pt;""><strong>The Law As It Presently Exists</strong></span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 10pt;"">Current school funding law requires the legislature to provide state funding to support basic education in public schools. The legislature defines the program of basic education that each school district must provide its students. The amount of state funding to be given to each school district each year is based on funding formulas. In 2009, the legislature revised its statutory funding formulas to be phased in by 2018. The Washington Supreme Court has held that by 2018 the state must provide sufficient funding to fully implement the revised formulas.</span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 10pt;"">Under the current school funding law, the legislature first determines what minimum costs, including minimum staffing costs, are necessary to operate prototypical elementary, middle, and high schools. Funding for each school district is then adjusted depending on how much a district&rsquo;s schools vary from the prototypical schools. Nothing in the current funding law requires school districts to maintain a particular classroom-teacher-to-student ratio or other staff-to-student ratio, or to use state funds to pay for particular types or classifications of staff. Thus, school districts have discretion to use their state funding to support different class sizes if they so choose.</span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 10pt;"">A prototypical high school has 600 full-time students, a prototypical middle school has 432 full-time students, and a prototypical elementary school has 400 full-time students. The minimum funding for each prototypical school must be based in part on the number of full-time classroom teachers needed to provide the minimum number of instruction hours, plus at least one teacher planning period per day. The current school funding law assumes general education average class sizes ranging from 25.23 students for grades K-3, to 28.74 students for grades 9-12.</span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 10pt;"">Current law requires that beginning with high poverty schools (meaning schools with the highest percentage of students eligible for free and reduced-price meals), the general education average class size for grades K-3 will be reduced, for funding purposes, to no more than 17 full-time students per teacher by the 2017-18 school year. In the 2013-14 budget, the legislature provided funding for reduced general education average class sizes in high poverty schools ranging from 20.85 students in grades K-1 for the 2013-14 school year, to 28.74 students in grades 9-12. For the 2014-15 school year, the legislature has also budgeted for increased funding for class size reduction in high poverty schools in grades K-1. High poverty schools will receive additional funding if they can demonstrate reduced actual average class sizes in grades K-1, down to a limit of 20.30 full time students per teacher.</span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 10pt;"">In 2014, the legislature added a requirement, effective in September 2014, that the minimum funding for a prototypical high school must also assume smaller class sizes for two laboratory science classes in grades 9-12. The minimum funding calculation must assume an average of 19.98 full time students for these laboratory classes. Separate funding calculations also assume average class sizes of 22.76 in skill centers and 26.57 for career and technical education in middle school and high school.</span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 10pt;"">Current law also calculates minimum allocations assuming certain additional staff for each prototypical school. These staff include administrators, like principals and assistant principals, librarians, school nurses, guidance counselors, psychologists, and other support staff. While the current funding law does not require any funding for parent involvement coordinators at any level, the legislature has budgeted 0.0825 for elementary school parent involvement coordinators for the 2014-15 school year. Current law also requires funding for staff providing district-wide services like technology support, maintenance, and mechanics to be set according to a statutory number of staff per thousand students.</span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 10pt;"">Finally, in addition to calculating minimum funding necessary for teachers and staff, current school funding law also sets minimum allocations per student for materials, supplies, and operating costs. The current budget provides for an increase in these allocations for all students for the 2014-15 school year, with an extra increase for high school students. The current school funding law also requires an additional increase in these allocations for the 2015-16 school year for all students.</span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 10pt;""><strong>The Effect of the Proposed Measure, if Approved</strong></span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 10pt;"">This measure would direct the legislature to allocate funds to reduce class sizes and increase staffing support for students in all K-12 grades, with additional class size reductions and staffing increases in high poverty schools. Funding increases would be phased in over a four-year period. &nbsp;The measure would increase the state&rsquo;s financial obligation to amply fund basic education by changing the formula for determining what basic education funds will be given to each school district each year.</span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 10pt;"">The measure would leave intact the statement in the school funding law that nothing in that law requires school districts to maintain a particular classroom-teacher-to-student ratio or other staff-to-student ratio, or to use state funds to pay for particular types or classifications of staff.</span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 10pt;"">The measure would require minimum funding based on the school district&rsquo;s demonstrated actual average class size, down to certain limits for each grade level.

Also, a firearms dealer can complete a sale if the sheriff or police chief fails to provide the results of a background check within five business days. That five day period can be extended if the buyer does not have a valid permanent Washington driver&rsquo;s license or identification card, or has lived in Washington for less than ninety days.</p><p>Washington law allows Washington residents to buy rifles and shotguns in other states. And it allows residents of other states to buy rifles and shotguns in Washington. In both cases, the sale must comply with federal law. The sale must also be legal under the laws of both Washington and the other state.</p><p>Federal law also requires background checks on potential buyers of firearms. This federal requirement applies only when the seller is a firearms dealer. Unlike Washington law, the federal requirement applies to all types of firearms, not just pistols. Federal law does not require a background check if the buyer holds a concealed pistol license. Also, federal law allows a firearms dealer to complete a sale if the results of a background check are not returned within three business days.</p><p>The federal and state constitutions prohibit governments from confiscating private property, including firearms, without providing due process of law. In general, due process requires a lawful basis for taking the property, notice of the government&rsquo;s action, and an opportunity to explain why property should not be forfeited. Court proceedings are examples of ways in which due process is provided. Washington law authorizes the forfeiture of firearms in a number of situations. Washington courts may order forfeiture of firearms found in the possession of people who cannot legally possess firearms or who have criminal proceedings pending. Courts may also order forfeiture of firearms that have been found concealed on a person who does not have a permit to carry a concealed pistol. Firearms used in the commission of certain crimes may also be forfeited. And firearms can be forfeited if found in the possession of a person arrested for a felony in which the firearm was used or displayed.</p><p><strong>The Effect Of The Proposed Measure If Approved</strong></p><p>This measure would prohibit government agencies from requiring background checks on the recipient of a firearm unless a uniform national standard is required.</p><p>This measure would also state that government agencies may not confiscate firearms from citizens without due process.</p>","<p>Initiative 591 would have no direct impact on state and local revenues, costs, expenditures or indebtedness.</p><p><strong>General Assumptions</strong></p><ul><li><span style=""font-size: 13px;"">The federal and state constitutions prohibit governments from confiscating private property, including firearms, without due process of law.

The net change cannot be estimated because the impact depends upon optional fees that may be charged by licensed firearms dealers. State expenditures for the Department of Licensing may total an estimated $921,000 over the next five years, which includes one-time implementation costs, ongoing expenses related to complying with current state pistol transfer laws and new license oversight requirements. State expenditures for enforcing the measure are estimated to be less than $50,000 per year. Local government expenditures are estimated to be less than $50,000 per year. &nbsp;</p><p><strong>General Assumptions</strong></p><p>The effective date of the initiative is December 4, 2014.</p><p>Estimates are described using the state&rsquo;s fiscal year (FY) of July 1 through June 30. FY 2015 is July 1, 2014, to June 30, 2015.</p><p><strong>State Revenue Assumptions</strong></p><p>Licensed firearms dealers may charge a fee for the administrative costs of facilitating the background check and private sale or transfer of a firearm.</p><p>Licensed firearms dealers would be required to pay the state business and occupation tax on any fees charged.</p><p>Licensed firearms dealers would not be required to collect sales or use tax when facilitating a private sale or transfer of a firearm.</p><p>Consistent with current law, a person would continue to be required to pay state use tax when purchasing or transferring a firearm in a private transaction.</p><p><strong>State Revenues</strong></p><p>Current law requires licensed firearms dealers to collect use tax from the Washington buyer in an interstate firearm sale or transfer. Under Initiative 594 (I-594) licensed dealers would no longer be required to collect use taxes on interstate sales or transfers. State revenues would be decreased minimally by the loss of use taxes on interstate sales or transfers no longer collected by licensed dealers.</p><p>I-594 authorizes licensed dealers to charge a fee to cover the administrative cost of facilitating background checks and private firearm sales and transfers. State revenues would be increased by the business and occupation taxes due on any fees charged by licensed firearms dealers. It is unknown how many licensed dealers will charge a fee or what any particular licensed dealer may set as the fee.</p><p>Therefore, I-594 would have a minimal impact on state revenues. The change in revenues cannot be estimated without information on whether licensed dealers would charge administrative fees, at what amount fees might be set, how many licensed dealers may charge administrative fees or the number of firearm purchases made each year where use taxes would be due.</p><p><strong>State Expenditure Assumptions</strong></p><p>All private pistol sales and transfers would be reported to the Department of Licensing (DOL).</p><p>Private sales or transfers of firearms other than pistols would not be reported to DOL.</p><p>DOL would process more pistol sales and transfer reports each year than it currently does.</p><p>DOL would print more pistol sales and transfer forms each year than it currently does.</p><p>DOL would modify the Business and Professions Firearm Database System to account for private pistol sales and transfers reported by licensed firearms dealers.</p><p>DOL would need additional staff for the increased pistol transfer workload and program administration, and to develop and manage new reporting requirements and license revocation authority.</p><p>About 90 percent of all licensed firearms dealers would report private pistol sales and transfers using paper forms.</p><p>Based on historical pistol sales and transfer data from DOL, the number of pistol sales and transfers reported to the agency would increase an average of 20 percent annually.</p><p><strong>State Expenditures</strong></p><p><strong>Licensing and Record Keeping</strong></p><p>Current law requires licensed firearms dealers to record all pistol sales or transfers with DOL. Firearms dealers may use a paper form or an electronic system to report the sale or transfer. In 2013, 89 percent of all licensed dealers used only paper forms.</p><p>Under I-594, licensed firearms dealers would continue to be required to report pistol sales and transfers to DOL. In addition, licensed firearms dealers would be required to report all private pistol sales and transfers they facilitate. The initiative includes exceptions to this requirement, such as transfers between certain family members. Private sales or transfers of firearms other than pistols would not be reported to DOL by a licensed firearms dealer.</p><p>Currently, a person who privately sells or transfers a pistol to another person may voluntarily record the change of ownership with DOL. The seller or transferor reports the change of ownership to DOL on a paper form. In August 2013, DOL began tracking the number of reported private pistol sales and transfers. From August 2013 to May 2014, DOL received 1,684 private sales and transfer reports.</p><p>Under I-594, the majority of private pistol sales and transfers would be reported to DOL through licensed firearms dealers. In an attempt to estimate the fiscal impact of this change, DOL reviewed data in Colorado on the number of private sales and transfers of pistols through licensed dealers. In 2014, Colorado implemented a law requiring all private pistol sales and transfers be processed through a licensed firearms dealer. The dealer must also conduct a background check on the buyer. Based on data from Colorado, DOL could receive about 12,900 private pistol sales and transfer reports in 2015.</p><p>DOL would experience increased expenditures and costs for printing and distributing more pistol sales and transfer forms, modifying the Business and Professions Firearm Database System, hiring a minimal number of staff to handle the additional paper forms submitted by dealers, hiring minimal program administration staff for developing and managing new reporting requirements and license revocation authority, and for rule making. The estimated total cost for these activities over the next five years is $921,000.

A person who knowingly violates Section 3 of the initiative could be subject to a gross misdemeanor, punishable under Chapter 9A.20 RCW. A person who knowingly violates Section 3 a second time, or more, is subject to a class C felony, punishable under Chapter 9A.20 RCW.</p><p>The sentence for the class C felony created in the initiative has a standard range of 0 to 12 months. Sentences of fewer than 12 months are typically served in county jail facilities. There would be no increase in state expenditures in cases where the sentence is served in a county facility.</p><p>Depending on the circumstances of the case, a judge may impose an aggravated exceptional sentence. If this results in a sentence that exceeds 12 months, the time would be served in a state prison facility and the state would experience increased costs. Assuming the number of cases where an aggravated exceptional sentence would be imposed does not exceed four per year, the Department of Corrections estimates the cost to be less than $50,000 a year.</p><p><strong>Local Government Revenue Assumptions</strong></p><p>Forty cities currently impose a local business and occupation tax. Licensed firearms dealers located in these cities would be required to pay a local business and occupation tax on any fees charged to facilitate a private firearm sale or transfer.</p><p>Licensed firearms dealers would not be required to collect sales or use tax when facilitating a private sale or transfer of a firearm.</p><p>Consistent with current law, a person would continue to be required to pay state use tax when purchasing or transferring a firearm in a private transaction.</p><p><strong>Local Government Revenues</strong></p><p>Local government revenues would be increased by the business and occupation taxes owed on any fees charged by a licensed firearms dealer facilitating background checks and firearms transfers in the 40 cities currently imposing a local business and occupation tax. Licensed dealers are not required to charge a fee. If there is a fee, it is set by the dealer. It is unknown how many dealers would charge a fee or what a particular dealer might set as the fee. Local government revenues would be decreased by the loss of use taxes no longer required to be collected by licensed firearms dealers.</p><p>Therefore, I-594 would have a minimal impact on local government revenues. The change in revenues cannot be estimated without information on whether licensed dealers would charge administrative fees, at what amount fees might be set, how many licensed dealers may charge administrative fees or the number of firearm purchases made each year where use taxes are due.</p><p><strong>Local Government Expenditure Assumptions</strong></p><p>No data are available to estimate the number of potential cases that would be investigated and charged for violations of I-594.</p><p>Other criminal justice cost data are available. These data were used to set a maximum number of cases that could occur statewide before local governments experience significant cost increases.</p><p>The maximum number of gross misdemeanor cases is 400 each year.</p><p>The maximum number of felony cases is 65 each year.</p><p><strong>Local Government Expenditures</strong></p><p>District and municipal courts (counties and cities) may experience increased costs for hearing additional gross misdemeanor cases. Superior courts (counties) may experience similar increased costs for hearing additional felony cases. The Administrative Office of the Courts estimates the fiscal impact of these cases to be less than $50,000 per fiscal year if there are fewer than 400 additional gross misdemeanor cases statewide each year and fewer than 65 additional felony cases statewide each year.&nbsp;</p>",,https://wei.sos.wa.gov/agency/osos/en/press_and_research/PreviousElections/2014/General-Election/Documents/I-594_Complete_Text.pdf,Statewide,,,,Change agricultural excise tax,Statewide,Advisory Measure,8,"<p>The legislature eliminated, without a vote of the people, agricultural excise tax preferences for various aspects of the marijuana industry, costing an estimated $24,903,000 in the first ten years, for government spending.</p> <p>Should this tax increase be repealed or maintained?</p>",,,,http://apps.leg.wa.gov/documents/billdocs/2013-14/Pdf/Bills/Senate%20Passed%20Legislature/6505.PL.pdf,Statewide,,,,Change leasehold excise tax,Statewide,Advisory Measure,9,"<p>The legislature imposed, without a vote of the people, the leasehold excise tax on certain leasehold interests in tribal property, costing an estimated $1,298,000 in the first ten years, for government spending.</p> <p>Should this tax increase be repealed or maintained? </p>",,,,http://apps.leg.wa.gov/documents/billdocs/2013-14/Pdf/Bills/House%20Passed%20Legislature/1287-S.PL.pdf,Statewide,,,,
