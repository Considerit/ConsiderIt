      About the Living Voters Guide

  #static-main
    %p.history
      We have offered the Living Voters Guide as a place for Washington citizens to hear each others' thoughts about ballot measures since 2010. LVG started as a collaboration between 
      %a{:href => "http://seattlecityclub.org", :target => "_blank"}
        Seattle CityClub 
      and a team of Computer Science and Political Science researchers at the University of Washington, funded by a National Science Foundation grant. Three elections later, the LVG is an 
      %a{:href => "/home/awards", :'data-target' => 'awards'}
        award-winning 
      civic platform for facilitating community deliberation about ballot measures, drawing participation from over 30,000 Washingtonians. 

    %p.history
      = succeed ',' do
        %a{:href => "http://consider.it", :target=>"_blank"}
          ConsiderIt    
      the technology we invented to power the LVG, encourages voters to think through the tradeoffs of a proposed ballot measure by inviting them to create a pro/con list that captures the most important factors in their decision. Beyond a traditional pro/con list, however, participants can also include into their own pro/con lists the points other citizens have already contributed. This encourages people to use the considerations of others to help them reach their own conclusions. From these activities, LVG creates an evolving guide to public thought on ballot issues. By identifying pros and cons that both supporters and opposers recognize as important, LVG draws attention to common ground. 

    %p.history
      Throughout, we have published 
      %a{:href => "/home/publications", :'data-target' => 'publications'}
        peer-reviewed articles 
      describing the design and evolution of the technology, while also analyzing the outcomes. For example, we have found that LVG encourages citizens to consider tradeoffs. Despite the contentious nature of many of these ballot measures, 45.0% of all pro/con lists include both pros and cons, demonstrating that it is possible to encourage citizens to consider tradeoffs and shed light on those more nuanced deliberations. In summative user studies, we've also found that citizens are surprised and encouraged when LVG shows people with whom they disagreed recognizing the importance of both pros and cons, especially when the “disagreers” included some of the same points they themselves thought important. Citizens could thus unexpectedly find common ground.

        The Seattle Public Library is providing on-demand reference assistance for users of the Living Voters Guide.

      %p
        To ask a librarian to check the facts of a claim on the Living Voters Guide, click the &#8220;Ask a Librarian&#8221; button at the bottom of each post. Librarians will respond to each request within 48 hours. We will assign each claim a status of &#8220;accurate,&#8221; &#8220;questionable,&#8221; or &#8220;unverifiable&#8221; and will post a response with further information and the sources used to evaluate the claim.

      %p
        We will make every effort to find a variety of sources and to post a fair, balanced, and complete response to each request. Librarians will spend up to two hours per request; if an answer cannot be found in this timeframe, we will note this in our response. Librarians are not experts on current ballot measures; but we are experts in finding information. We will respond to all requests and present the best information we can find in an attempt to evaluate the veracity of a claim.

      %p
        Some types of questions fall beyond the boundaries of what librarians are able to verify:
      %ul
        %li
          We will not conduct in-depth legal or financial analysis, but we will point users to research that has already been conducted.
        %li
          We will not evaluate the merits of value or opinion statements, but we will evaluate factual components of these statements.
        %li
          We will not evaluate the likelihood of hypothetical statements, but we will evaluate factual components of these statements.

      %p
        The Library is not the final word on what is the truth. Our responses represent our best effort of evaluating statements by Living Voters Guide users, given the information we are able to find. This is an experiment; we hope that our efforts will support informed discussion of civic issues.

      %h3
        How it works

      %p 
        When you're browsing pro/con points, you can click on a point to expand it. If you would like a librarian to fact check it, click the button "Ask a librarian to fact check this point". You can then describe what claim you'd like them to investigate. The librarians will try to respond within 48 hours. 

      %p
        The results of the fact checks will be shown to all LVG participants. When browsing the pros and cons, you can see that points marked with a checkmark contain accurate claims, points marked with an ellipsis (...) contain unverifiable claims, and points marked with a question mark contain questionable claims that appears to be inaccurate.

        The Living Voters Guide brings together 
        voters to discuss and explore their positions on ballot measures. Unlike traditional voters’ guides issued by governments, advocacy groups, and other organizations, 
        it is co-created solely by its participants. It will evolve continuously throughout the election season as citizens consider the tradeoffs for each measure.

      Welcome to the Living Voters Guide! The following terms of use are provided to make explicit your rights and

      Participation rules

    %p
      In order to foster an environment conducive to civil and on-topic political discussion, please abide by the following rules. Violation of any of these rules may result in account suspension or deactivation.

    %ul
      %li
        Do not make personal attacks or use offensive language. Disagreement is both inevitable and welcome on the LVG; offensive behavior is not. In your posts please refrain from name-calling; using expletives; slurs against race, ethnicity, gender, and sexual orientation; and other insults. A basic rule of thumb is to focus your attention on the initiatives themselves rather than on the people advocating or opposing them. Doing so will help ensure that the LVG is a welcoming space for all Washington citizens.
      %li
        Express only your own opinions and not those of any campaign, candidate, or party. We are interested only in the opinions of private citizens, and specifically not in the positions of established political parties or interest groups. Therefore when you express yourself on the LVG, please make sure to express only your own personal opinion. Of course, it's fine if your personal opinion is similar to one from a party or interest group, but please use your own words in expressing it. The bottom line is, no one should be using this site as part of their paid advocacy duties.
      %li
        Though you may change your stance at any time, do not create multiple accounts. Please sign up for and use one and only one account. Multiple accounts belonging to a single individual will be deactivated immediately.

      Seattle City Club is cooperating with a research group at the University of Washington.  The purpose of our research is to design and test new software systems to better support civic engagement and participation. For more information, please see our research project website http://engage.cs.washington.edu or send email to civic-engagement@cs.washington.edu.

      By using this site, you certify that you agree to have information about how you use this site collected.  For people who read the discussion and take positions, we are collecting session logs.  These logs are completely anonymized – we aren’t collecting any information in these logs that could identify you personally.  For people who post new content, the items on the site are all publicly visible on the internet.

    %p
      For people who read information on the site and perhaps take positions, we are collecting session logs that record users’ interaction with the website, including a hash of the IP address of the machine they are coming from, the geographic region of the IP address, timestamped keystrokes, mouse clicks, and mouse position.  We are also recording a hash of the login name of any logged in user.  A “hash” of the IP address means that we will take the actual internet address and transform it into a unique code that will only correspond to that particular IP address.  However, this will be a one-way cryptographic transformation: the stored information will let us determine whether this is the same address when used again, but won’t let us (or anyone else) determine the actual IP address from the hash.  Similarly, by taking the hash of the login name, we can determine whether two sessions are from the same user without storing any personally identifying information.

      For people who are posting new content, the items on the site are all publicly visible on the internet.
