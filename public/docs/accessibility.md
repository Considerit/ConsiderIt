# Consider.it Accessibility

Considerit functionality meets WCAG 2.0 Level A accessibility requirements. The few exceptions are explained below. We have tried to go beyond accessibility standards by user testing with blind folks to identify usability issues. We have also augmented Considerit with a fallback for visually-impaired users who have trouble using the system to contact us to ask for help. We help each of these folks individually to understand the proposals being discussed and input their opinions.

## Outstanding accessibility issues

* It is not possible to use the keyboard to highlight different sections of the histogram.  
* It is not possible to use the keyboard to inspect a single user’s pro and con points that user thinks are important.   
* It is not possible to use the keyboard to get a list of the specific users who think a particular point is important. 

None of these are core features of Consider.it. 

# WCAG 2.0 Conformance Declaration

This WCAG Conformance statement is modeled after the Voluntary Product Accessibility Statement ([VPAT](https://www.itic.org/policy/accessibility/)) for Section 508, but using the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines ([WCAG](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20/)) as conformance criteria instead. The format below is more useful than the existing VPAT format because Section 508 is out-of-date and its eventual Refresh will incorporate WCAG by reference. The format and some language borrowed from Accessibility leader [tenon.io](https://tenon.io).

### Guideline 1.1 Text Alternatives

| Success Criteria | Supporting features | Remarks and Explanations |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **1.1.1 Non-Text Content** All non-text content that is presented to the user has a text alternative that serves the equivalent purpose, except for the situations listed below.  **Controls, Input**: If non-text content is a control or accepts user input, then it has a name that describes its purpose. **Time-Based Media**: If non-text content is time-based media, then text alternatives at least provide descriptive identification of the non-text content. **Test**: If non-text content is a test or exercise that would be invalid if presented in text, then text alternatives at least provide descriptive identification of the non-text content. **Sensory**: If non-text content is primarily intended to create a specific sensory experience, then text alternatives at least provide descriptive identification of the non-text content. **CAPTCHA**: If the purpose of non-text content is to confirm that content is being accessed by a person rather than a computer, then text alternatives that identify and describe the purpose of the non-text content are provided, and alternative forms of CAPTCHA using output modes for different types of sensory perception are provided to accommodate different disabilities. **Decoration, Formatting, Invisible**: If non-text content is pure decoration, is used only for visual formatting, or is not presented to users, then it is implemented in a way that it can be ignored by assistive technology.  | Supports | Considerit the platform only uses graphics for user avatars. Proper text alternatives are provided. Considerit can be customized for particular clients, including the ability to add custom homepage containing graphics, or proposals with embedded graphics. Those graphics can also be provided with text alternatives. It is the responsibility of the client to provide them to the Considerit team.   |

### Guideline 2.1 Keyboard Accessible

| Success Criteria | Supporting features | Remarks and Explanations |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **2.1.1 Keyboard** All functionality of the content is operable through a keyboard interface without requiring specific timings for individual keystrokes, except where the underlying function requires input that depends on the path of the user's movement and not just the endpoints.  | Supports with exceptions | All core functionality is keyboard accessible. A few tertiary features are not accessible by keyboard. See a description of these features [here](#outstanding-accessibility-issues). |
| **2.1.2 No Keyboard Trap** If keyboard focus can be moved to a component of the page using a keyboard interface, then focus can be moved away from that component using only a keyboard interface, and, if it requires more than unmodified arrow or tab keys or other standard exit methods, the user is advised of the method for moving focus away.  | Supports | There are no keyboard traps in Considerit. |

| **2.5.2 Pointer Cancellation** For functionality that can be operated using a single pointer, at least one of the following is true:<br>No Down-Event: The down-event of the pointer is not used to execute any part of the function;<br>Abort or Undo: Completion of the function is on the up-event, and a mechanism is available to abort the function before completion or to undo the function after completion;<br>Up Reversal: The up-event reverses any outcome of the preceding down-event;<br>Essential: Completing the function on the down-event is essential. | | |
| **2.5.3 Label in Name** For user interface components with labels that include text or images of text, the name contains the text that is presented visually. | | |
| **2.5.4 Motion Actuation** Functionality that can be operated by device motion or user motion can also be operated by user interface components and responding to the motion can be disabled to prevent accidental actuation, except when: <br>Supported Interface: The motion is used to operate functionality through an accessibility supported interface;<br>Essential: The motion is essential for the function and doing so would invalidate the activity. | | |


### Guideline 3.1 Readable

| Success Criteria | Supporting features | Remarks and Explanations |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **3.1.1 Language of the Page** The default human language of each Web page can be programmatically determined.  | Supports | The language of the page is indicated programmatically, through the use of the lang attribute on the HTMLelement |

### Guideline 3.2 Predictable

| Success Criteria | Supporting features | Remarks and Explanations |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **3.2.1 On Focus** When any component receives focus, it does not initiate a change of context.  | Supports | Considerit does not change context when an item gets focus |
| **3.2.2 On Input** Changing the setting of any user interface component does not automatically cause a change of context unless the user has been advised of the behavior before using the component.  | Supports | Considerit does not change context when the settings of a control has changed. |
| **3.2.6 Consistent Help** If a Web page contains any of the following help mechanisms, and those mechanisms are repeated on multiple Web pages within a set of Web pages, they occur in the same order relative to other page content, unless a change is initiated by the user: <br>Human contact details;<br>Human contact mechanism;<br>Self-help option;<br>A fully automated contact mechanism.<br>Note 1: A fully automated contact mechanism.<br>Note 2: For this Success Criterion, “the same order relative to other page content” can be thought of as how the content is ordered when the page is serialized. The visual position of a help mechanism is likely to be consistent across pages for the same page variation (e.g., CSS break-point). The user can initiate a change, such as changing the page’s zoom or orientation, which may trigger a different page variation. This criterion is concerned with relative order across pages displayed in the same page variation (e.g., same zoom level and orientation). | | |
