# Consider.it Processors

Updated: May 2025

## Hosting Regions and Data Residency

* **US Server:** AWS and Linode services are hosted in the United States, except for database backups, which are in the EU.
* **EU Server:** AWS and Linode services are hosted in the EU.
* **CA Server:** AWS and Linode services are hosted in Canada, except for database backups, which are in the EU.
* **AU Server:** AWS and Linode services are hosted in Australia, except for database backups, which are in the EU.

We aim to minimize cross-border data transfer. For our EU server, data stays within the EU unless optional features (namely Google Translate) are explicitly enabled by the forum host.

In the below subprocessor table, the jurisdiction of the subprocessor is shown for each of our respective regional servers. For example, Consider.itâ€™s EU server is served by a Linode cloud provider residing in the EU.

## Subprocessors

We use third-party subprocessors, such as cloud computing providers and customer support software, to run Consider.it (the service). We have minimized the number of these subprocessors where possible. When we do use a subprocessor, we ensure each has a GDPR-compliant data processing agreement.

### Third-Party Services Activated by Forum Hosts (Not Subprocessors)

These optional services process data under their own terms and are not subprocessors of Consider.it. Forum hosts (controllers) can choose to enable or disable them.

These subprocessors are only involved when a customer creates or purchases a forum via our product page.
