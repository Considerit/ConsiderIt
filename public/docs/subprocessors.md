Consider.it Processors
=======================
Updated: February 2023

Subprocessors 
-------------

We use third party subprocessors, such as cloud computing providers and customer support software, to run Consider.it (the service). We have tried to minimize the number of these processors. And when we do use a subprocessor, we try to ensure each subprocessor has a GDPR-compliant data processing agreement. And if they don't, we provide an option for the respective forum host in charge of controlling how Consider.it processes data to disable processing by that subprocessor (e.g. Google Translate).

The following is a list of personal data subprocessors we use.

*   [Linode](https://www.linode.com/legal/) - Cloud computing services. Linode hosts our US, EU, and Canadian servers.
*   [Amazon Web Services](https://aws.amazon.com/compliance/gdpr-center/) - Cloud computing services. The [AWS service terms](https://aws.amazon.com/service-terms/) for all AWS systems incorporates a GDPR compliant DPA.
    * [Cloudfront](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/data-protection-summary.html)
    * [S3](https://d1.awsstatic.com/legal/aws-dpa/aws-dpa.pdf)
    * [SES](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ses/latest/dg/data-protection.html) - Transactional email service. Most machine-generated Consider.it emails are sent via SES.
*   [Mailgun](https://www.mailgun.com/gdpr/) - Some machine-generated Consider.it emails are sent via Mailgun.
*   [Plausible](https://plausible.io/data-policy) - Privacy-first analytics service. Based in the EU.
*   Google Translate - Language Translation. Can be turned off entirely for a given forum.
*   [Stripe](https://stripe.com/legal/dpa) - Billing. Stripe is only loaded for a Customer trying to pay for a premium forum.




For our US server, AWS and Linode services are hosted on servers in the US. 

The EU has strong privacy laws. A core tenet of the GDPR is that if we transfer any personal data of EU residents out of the EU, we must protect it to the same level as guaranteed under EU law. We try to minimize the amount of cross-border data transfer. For our European server, AWS and Linode services are hosted on servers in the EU. Plausible is also based in the EU. We use an EU-based Mailgun server for our Consider.it EU server. Google Translate is disabled by default on the EU server. 

For our Canadian server, AWS and Linode services are hosted on servers in Canada.
