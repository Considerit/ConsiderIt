  Hi! 

%p
  Thanks for taking a stance on "#{@proposal.title}".

%p
  Before your vote will be counted in the totals, we ask that you verify your email address by visiting #{confirmation_url(@user, :confirmation_token => @user.confirmation_token, :host => @options[:host])}. 

%p 
  Why? We want to ensure that people are registering their opinions using a real email address. Otherwise, it will be easier to commit the equivalent of voter fraud.

  Thanks!
