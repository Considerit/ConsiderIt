One of those provisions, article VI, section 1A, is inoperative because of court decisions and a more recent amendment to the other provision, article VI, section 1.<br> &nbsp;<br> Article VI, section 1, provides that all citizens who are at least eighteen years old are entitled to vote if they have lived in the state, county, and precinct for at least 30 days before the election. The second provision, article VI, section 1A, states that all citizens of the United States who become residents of Washington during a presidential election year may vote for the offices of president and vice president if they resided in Washington for at least 60 days before the election.<br> &nbsp;<br> The voters added article VI, section 1A, to the state constitution in 1966 as Amendment 46. At that time, article VI, section 1, of the state constitution required voters to reside in the state for a full year prior to voting and, in addition, required that they live in the county for 90 days and the city, town, ward, or precinct for 30 days before the election. Therefore, when section 1A was added to the constitution in 1966, it provided a more lenient residency requirement so that new residents of the state could vote for president and vice president after a shorter, 60-day period of residency. <br> &nbsp;<br> After the voters approved adding section 1A to the state constitution, the United States Supreme Court ruled that any requirement that voters live in a particular place longer than 30 days in order to vote is unconstitutional. Based upon that holding, the Washington Supreme Court held that the 90-day county and one-year state residency requirements stated in article VI, section 1, were unconstitutional. Washington voters then approved amending article VI, section 1, to read as it does today in order to conform to the court decisions, but this amendment did not repeal or change article VI, section 1A. Washington law therefore currently entitles all otherwise-qualified citizens to vote if they have resided within the state, county, and precinct for at least 30 days. <br> &nbsp;<br> Article VI, section 1A, remains part of the state constitution, but has no operative effect.<br> &nbsp;<br> <b>The Effect of the Proposed Amendment, if Approved</b> This measure proposes to amend the state constitution to remove article VI, section 1A, from the state constitution. The state constitution would continue to entitle all otherwise-eligible citizens of the United States to vote if they have resided in Washington, and in their county and precinct, for at least 30 days before the election.<p>',

  :designator => '1125',
  :long_description => '<b>The Law as it Presently Exists</b><br> The
  legislature has enacted various laws that direct where and how tolls
  can be set for bridges, ferries, tunnels, roads, and related
  facilities. Those laws also restrict the ways in which toll revenue
  can be used. Initiative Measure No. 1125 would impose additional
  restrictions on the use of toll revenue.<br> &nbsp;<br> The
  Eighteenth Amendment to the Washington Constitution requires that
  certain state revenue be used only for &ldquo;highway
  purposes.&rdquo; That amendment, which was approved in 1944,
  provides that the following revenue must be paid into the state
  treasury and placed in a special fund to be used exclusively for
  &ldquo;highway purposes&rdquo;: all fees the state collects as
  license fees for motor vehicles; all excise taxes the state collects
  on the sale, distribution, or use of motor vehicle fuel; and all
  other state revenue &ldquo;intended to be used for highway
  purposes.&rdquo; That fund is the &ldquo;motor vehicle fund&rdquo;
  established in RCW 46.68.070. The Eighteenth Amendment also lists
  some uses that must be considered &ldquo;highway purposes,&rdquo;
  including the necessary operating, engineering, and legal expenses
  connected with the administration of public highways, county roads,
  and city streets; and the construction, reconstruction, maintenance,
  repair, and betterment of public highways, county roads, bridges,
  and city streets.<br> &nbsp;<br> Since well before the adoption of
  the Eighteenth Amendment, the legislature has authorized the use of
  tolls as one means of paying for the acquisition, construction, and
  operation of bridges, ferries, tunnels, roads, and related
  facilities. That authority includes the use of tolls to retire bonds
  issued to finance acquisition and construction of bridges, ferries,
  tunnels, roads, and related facilities; tolls used for that purpose
  must be deposited in special trust funds kept separate from all
  other funds.<br> &nbsp;<br> Under current law, the legislature must
  authorize the collection of tolls but it can delegate the authority
  to set the amounts of tolls. The legislature has designated the
  state Transportation Commission as the &ldquo;tolling
  authority&rdquo; responsible for setting most tolls, under standards
  and guidelines established in law to ensure that the revenue
  generated by tolls is sufficient to pay maintenance and operating
  costs for the facility; pay principal and interest on bonds, related
  financing costs, and insurance; and reimburse the motor vehicle fund
  for any money used from that fund to pay for bonds.&nbsp; Unless
  otherwise provided in law, all revenue from a toll facility is to be
  used for that facility, and tolls may continue to be collected after
  initial construction has been paid for to fund additional capacity,
  maintenance, and operation of the facility.<br> &nbsp;<br> <b>The
  Effect of the Proposed Measure, if Approved</b><br> Initiative
  Measure No. 1125 would require that toll amounts be set by the
  legislature by majority vote, rather than by the Transportation
  Commission, and would make the setting of toll amounts subject to
  statutes that require preparation of various reports and analyses
  relating to costs. It would require that tolls be &ldquo;uniform and
  consistent&rdquo; and would not allow variable pricing of
  tolls. (&ldquo;Variable priced&rdquo; tolls typically are higher
  during periods of traffic congestion and lower at other times of the
  day or week.)<br> &nbsp;<br> While the measure would leave in place
  the authority to collect and use tolls for the preservation,
  maintenance, management, and operation of a facility, it would add
  provisions that limit the use of some tolls to construction and
  capital improvement only and that require tolls on future facilities
  to end after the cost of the project is paid. The measure would
  require revenue from tolls to be used only for purposes
  &ldquo;consistent with&rdquo; the Eighteenth Amendment, and would
  prohibit any revenue in the motor vehicle fund or any toll fund from
  being transferred to the &ldquo;general fund or other funds&rdquo;
  and used for &ldquo;non-transportation purposes.&rdquo;<br>
  &nbsp;<br> The measure would restate the existing requirement that
  tolls must be used on the facility for which they are collected,
  explicitly referencing the Interstate 90 floating bridge. The
  measure also would prohibit the state or a state agency from
  transferring or using &ldquo;gas-tax-funded or toll-funded lanes on
  state highways&rdquo; for &ldquo;non-highway purposes.&rdquo; <p> ',

Toll revenue from this facility must be used exclusively for toll facilities and capital improvements on Interstate 90 and only for highway purposes.</li> </ul>  &nbsp;<br> <b>State and Local Fiscal Impacts</b><br> Section 2. No fiscal impact is assumed from this section. Expenditures from the Motor Vehicle Fund and toll funds are restricted by law to transportation purposes.<br> &nbsp;<br> Section 3. This restriction is assumed to have no impact on state or local revenues. The restriction also does not direct new expenditures or new costs. Therefore, it is assumed that state and local governments will adjust their actions to comply with this restriction, resulting in no new increased or decreased costs.<br> &nbsp;<br> Sections 4 through 8 are described by tolled facility:<br> &nbsp;<br> Tacoma Narrows Bridge<br> These sections do not apply to this bridge, and therefore, no fiscal impact is assumed.<br> &nbsp;<br> State Route 167 High-Occupancy Vehicle Lanes<br> Because these tolled lanes were first authorized before July 1, 2008, only Section 4 applies to them. Tolls are authorized for this facility until June 30, 2013. It is not anticipated that toll rates will increase during this authorization. Therefore, no fiscal impact is assumed on toll revenues from the lanes. There is no debt on these lanes.<br> &nbsp;<br> Tolls collected from high-occupancy toll lanes can be used to increase transit, vanpool, carpool and trip reduction services in the State Route 167 corridor, which could be inconsistent with highway purposes. However, enacted budgets provide that all tolls collected from the lanes be used solely for the operation, administration and enforcement of these lanes. Therefore, no fiscal impact is assumed for state and local expenditures.<br> &nbsp;<br> State Route 520 Bridge<br> Sections 4 though 7 apply to this bridge. Tolls are authorized and have been set for this bridge. The Legislature has identified toll revenue as part of the State Route 520 bridge replacement and high-occupancy vehicle program. It is not known whether a toll rate increase will be necessary during the period covered by this fiscal impact statement. However, if it is necessary, the Legislature will need to act to set tolls subject to requirements contained in Section 7.<br> &nbsp;<br> Current law requires the use of variable tolling. If a toll rate increase is necessary, a new toll rate analysis and supplemental environmental review will be required to implement a uniform and consistent toll rate. Assuming that these analyses can be conducted concurrently within project schedules, the cost is estimated at up to $3.2 million. Prior analysis indicates that a fixed toll rate equivalent to the weighted average of variable tolls could reduce revenue by up to 11 percent due to different traffic patterns (Parsons Brinckerhoff analysis, March 2008). However, because a new analysis is necessary to quantify impacts and it is not certain that a toll rate increase is necessary during the period covered by the fiscal impact statement, the impact on toll revenue is indeterminate.<br> &nbsp;<br> Federal Urban Partnership Agreement (UPA) grants were awarded to the Washington State Department of Transportation, King County and King County Ferry District conditioned on implementing variable tolling on the existing State Route 520 bridge. If a toll rate increase is necessary and variable tolling is prohibited, the state, King County and King County Ferry District would lose authority to spend remaining grant funds and could be required to repay the entire grant amount. The state has spent $64.4 million of the state&rsquo;s $86.1 million UPA grant, leaving $21.7 million remaining as of July 2011. King County has spent $34.8 million of the county&rsquo;s $41 million UPA grant, leaving $6.2 million remaining as of July 2011. The King County Ferry District was awarded $1 million, none of which has been spent as of July 2011. Because it is not known if a toll rate increase is necessary during the period covered by the fiscal impact statement or what action the federal government will take, the impact on this grant revenue is indeterminate.<br> &nbsp;<br> Tolls collected from State Route 520 can be used to provide for the operations of conveyances of people or goods, which could be inconsistent with highway purposes. However, current law and enacted budgets provide that tolls collected from State Route 520 must be used for operation and administration of the tolled bridge and high-occupancy vehicle program and to repay bond obligations used to finance construction and capital improvement costs, which are assumed to be consistent with highway purposes. Therefore, no fiscal impact is assumed on state and local government expenditures during the period covered by the fiscal impact statement.<br> &nbsp;<br> Current law authorizes the issuance of $1.95 billion in bonds secured solely by toll revenue or secured by both toll and gas tax revenue. The State Treasurer states that requiring tolls to be set and adjusted by the Legislature rather than by an independent toll-setting body would make the cost of bonds secured solely by toll revenue prohibitively expensive and would be unprecedented nationally. Because investors in toll revenue bonds see the independence of toll-setting bodies as a critical credit characteristic, no other toll revenue bond issuer in the nation sets tolls subject to legislative approval (Public Resource Advisory Group analysis, Feb. 8, 2011). Therefore, the State Treasurer states that bonds secured solely by toll revenue would be eliminated as a financing tool for the bridge. Gas tax or other revenues would be necessary to issue bonds, reducing overall capacity to finance transportation projects, which may impact future expenditures.<br> &nbsp;<br> Interstate 405 High-Occupancy Vehicle Lanes<br> Sections 4 though 7 apply to these lanes. Tolls are authorized for these lanes, but tolls have not been set. Current law requires the use of dynamic tolling. To implement a uniform and consistent toll rate, a new toll rate analysis and supplemental environmental review would be required. Assuming that these analyses can be conducted concurrently within project schedules, the cost is estimated at up to $2.5 million. Because the new analysis is necessary to quantify impacts, the impact on toll revenue is indeterminate.<br> &nbsp;<br> Tolls collected from Interstate 405 high-occupancy vehicle lanes can be used to provide for the operations of conveyances of people or goods, which could be inconsistent with the highway purposes. However, current law and enacted budgets provide that tolls collected from the lanes must be used for operation and administration of the tolled lanes and to repay bond obligations to finance construction and capital improvement costs, which are assumed to be consistent with the highway purposes. Therefore, no fiscal impact is assumed on state and local government expenditures during the period covered by the fiscal impact statement.<br> &nbsp;<br> Current bond authorizations for construction and capital improvements of Interstate 405 high-occupancy vehicle lanes from Bellevue to Lynnwood are secured by gas tax revenue. Therefore, no fiscal impact is assumed on indebtedness for these lanes.<br> &nbsp;<br> State Route 99 Alaskan Way Viaduct<br> Sections 4 though 7 apply to this highway. Tolls have not been authorized by the Legislature. Current toll rate analysis for this highway has assumed the use of variable pricing. To implement a uniform and consistent rate, a new toll rate analysis and supplemental environmental review would be required. Assuming that these analyses can be conducted concurrently within project schedules, the cost is estimated at up to $2.6 million. Because tolls have not been authorized and the new analysis is necessary to quantify impacts, the impact to toll revenue is indeterminate.<br> &nbsp;<br> The Legislature has identified toll revenue as part of the State Route 99 Alaskan Way Viaduct replacement project. This expenditure is assumed to be consistent with the highway purposes. Therefore, no fiscal impact is assumed on state and local expenditures.<br> &nbsp;<br> Current bond authorizations for construction and capital improvements for portions of the State Route 99 Alaskan Way Viaduct replacement project are secured by gas tax revenue. If costs exceed $2.4 billion, no more than $400 million of additional costs will be financed with toll revenue. Because there is no authorization to use toll revenue for bonds, the fiscal impact on indebtedness for this highway is indeterminate. Additionally, the State Treasurer states that bonds secured solely by toll revenue would be eliminated as a financing tool for this highway.<br> &nbsp;<br> Interstate 90 Floating Bridge<br> Sections 4 though 8 will apply to this bridge. Whether the Legislature will authorize tolls on the Interstate 90 floating bridge and for what purpose are unknown. Therefore, the fiscal impact is unknown and indeterminate. Additionally, State Treasurer states that bonds secured solely by toll revenue would be eliminated as a financing tool for this highway.<br> &nbsp;<br> Future Facilities<br> Sections 4 though 7 will apply to future tolled facilities. The Washington State Department of Transportation was directed by the Legislature to conduct tolling analysis on the Interstate 5 Columbia River Crossing in Clark County, Interstate 5 express lanes between Seattle and Northgate, Interstate 90 in King County, Interstate 405 high-occupancy vehicle lanes from Bellevue south, State Route 509 in King County and State Route 167 extension in Pierce County. Whether the Legislature will authorize tolling on these highways and for what purpose are unknown. Therefore, the fiscal impact is unknown and indeterminate. Additionally, the State Treasurer states that bonds secured solely by toll revenue would be eliminated as a financing tool for these bridges and highways.'

  :designator => '1163',
  :long_description => '<b>The Law as it Presently Exists</b><br>
    Long-term care workers assist the elderly and persons with
    disabilities in the homes of the people they assist or through
    assisted living facilities, adult family homes, or state-licensed
    boarding homes. Assistance by long-term care workers may include
    help with eating, dressing, bathing, meal preparation, household
    chores, and other assistance with daily life. Long-term care
    workers might provide this assistance under a direct contract with
    the state as an individual provider, or they might be employees of
    home care agencies or other facilities. Long-term care workers
    include respite care providers, community residential service
    providers, and any other worker who directly provides home or
    community-based services to the elderly or persons with functional
    or developmental disabilities. Long-term care workers do not
    include employees of nursing homes, hospitals or other acute care
    facilities, adult day care centers, or adult day health
    providers. Long-term care workers are paid according to a
    collective bargaining agreement negotiated with the state, subject
    to legislative approval.<br> &nbsp;<br> State law currently
    requires that long-term care workers receive training. Additional
    requirements are scheduled to take effect in the future. Under
    current law, long-term care workers hired on or after January 1,
    2014, will be required to be certified by the state Department of
    Health as &ldquo;home care aides&rdquo; within 150 days of
    beginning work. To be certified, long-term care workers will need
    to complete specific training and pass an examination. The
    requirement that long-term care workers receive 35 hours of basic
    training will increase to a 75-hour requirement on January 1,
    2014. State law requires that the state pay for the training, and
    pay long-term care workers for the time they spend in
    training. After they are certified, long-term care workers hired
    after January 1, 2014, will be required to receive 12 hours of
    continuing training each year. There are reduced requirements for
    those who only provide care for their own adult children or
    parents. The state will also be required to offer advanced
    training to long-term care workers beginning January 1, 2014.<br>
    &nbsp;<br> State law also requires that long-term care workers
    receive criminal background checks. These checks determine whether
    long-term care workers have a criminal history that would
    disqualify them from working with vulnerable persons. These checks
    currently look only for criminal convictions in Washington. If the
    worker has lived in Washington less than three years, then a
    fingerprint-based check also is conducted through the Federal
    Bureau of Investigation (FBI). All long-term care workers hired
    after January 1, 2014, will be required to receive a
    fingerprint-based check through the FBI, no matter how long they
    have lived in Washington.<br> &nbsp;<br> <b>The Effect of the
    Proposed Measure, if Approved</b><br> Initiative Measure 1163
    would move up the date by which the additional training,
    certification, and background check requirements for long-term
    care workers take effect. The requirement that long-term care
    workers receive certification as &ldquo;home care aides,&rdquo;
    and receive additional training would apply to all long-term care
    workers hired on or after January 7, 2012, instead of January 1,
    2014. The requirement that long-term care workers receive criminal
    background checks through the FBI would apply to all long-term
    care workers hired on or after January 1, 2012, instead of January
    1, 2014. Community residential service providers would not be
    covered by these additional training, certification, and
    background check requirements until January 1, 2016. <br>
    &nbsp;<br> In addition, this measure would require that the state
    auditor conduct performance audits of the state&rsquo;s long-term
    in-home care program. The first audit would have to be completed
    within twelve months after this measure takes effect. The auditor
    would be required to conduct performance audits &ldquo;on a
    biannual basis thereafter.&rdquo; This measure would also require
    the state to hire five additional fraud investigators.<br>
    &nbsp;<br> This measure would require the state to limit its
    administrative expenses so that at least 90% of taxpayer spending
    on the long-term in-home care program is devoted to direct
    care. The state would be required to achieve this limitation
    within two years after this measure takes effect. This measure
    also provides that if the passage of this act triggers changes to
    any collective bargaining agreement, then those changes go into
    effect immediately without the need for legislative approval.<p>',
  :additional_details => '<p>Current law requires increased
    mandatory training, background checks and certification for
    long-term care workers, depending on worker classification,
    beginning Jan. 1, 2014. Initiative 1163 would require the
    training, background checks and certification for long-term care
    workers to begin Jan. 7, 2012, but delay these requirements for
    community residential providers until Jan 1, 2016. For the
    long-term in-home care program, administrative costs are capped
    and performance audits with additional fraud investigators are
    required. Over six fiscal years, costs are estimated to increase
    $31.3 million and revenue from the federal government and fees is
    estimated to increase $18.4 million.</p> <p> <b>General
    Assumptions</b> <br> The Washington State Office of Financial
    Management, in consultation with the Washington State Department
    of Social and Health Services (DSHS) and Department of Health
    (DOH), developed a model to estimate the costs and expenditures of
    implementing increased mandatory training, background checks and
    certification for long-term care workers. This model was first
    developed for the fiscal impact statement for Initiative 1029,
    passed in 2008, and subsequently used for fiscal notes on
    legislation, including Engrossed Substitute Senate Bill 6180
    (2009) and Engrossed Substitute House Bill 1548 (2011). This
    statement uses this model updated to the June 2011 Caseload
    Forecast Council forecast (forecast).</p> <p> The following
    assumptions are used to measure fiscal impacts: <ul> <li>Estimates
    are described using the state&#39;s fiscal year (FY) of July 1
    through June 30.</li> <li>The initiative applies prospectively
    with an implementation date of Jan. 7, 2012.</li> <li>Current law
    directs that increased mandatory training, background checks and
    certification for long-term care workers begin Jan. 1, 2014. The
    initiative would require training, background checks and
    certifications to begin Jan. 7, 2012, but delay the requirements
    for workers who are community residential service providers to
    Jan. 1, 2016. Revenues, expenditures and costs already assumed to
    begin Jan. 1, 2014, are netted against revenues, expenditures and
    costs generated from the initiative.</li> <li>Increased mandatory
    training, background checks and certification requirements vary by
    type of long-term care worker: <ul> <li>Beginning Jan. 7, 2012,
    workers who care for the elderly or persons with disabilities are
    required to complete 75 hours of mandatory training (up from 35
    hours), background checks and certification. The training includes
    five hours of basic safety information and orientation that must
    be completed before the worker begins employment. The remaining 70
    hours must be completed within 120 days of the worker being hired
    and can include 12 hours of structured peer mentoring.</li>
    <li>Beginning Jan. 7, 2012, workers hired as individual providers
    who care for their own elderly or disabled parent or child, or
    individual providers who work 20 hours or less per month are
    required to complete increased mandatory training (the amount
    varies), background checks and certification requirements.</li>
    <li>Beginning Jan. 1, 2016, workers who are community residential
    providers (supported living providers) are required to complete 75
    hours of mandatory training (up from 35 hours), and background
    checks, but do not require certification.</li> <li>All workers are
    required to complete 12 hours of continuing education courses each
    year to maintain certification. DSHS must offer, but not require,
    advanced training to long-term care workers.</li> </ul> <li>The
    number of workers who would receive training was developed using
    the June 2011 Caseload Forecast Council estimate of the number of
    long-term care clients.</li> <li>Current wage information was used
    as the basis for wage costs, with no inflationary increases
    included.</li> <li>The initiative does not trigger changes to the
    collective bargaining agreement reached between the state and the
    exclusive bargaining representative of long-term care
    workers. Therefore, no fiscal impact is assumed.</li> <li>No
    revenue, cost, expenditure or indebtedness impacts are assumed for
    local governments.</li> <li>There is no state debt associated with
    long-term care worker training and background check
    requirements. Therefore, state fiscal impacts are limited to
    revenues, costs and expenditures.</li> </ul> </p> <p> <b>State

    150 days of employment. Workers would not be paid for the time
    spent taking the certification exam. The combined net cost of
    these expenditures is estimated to be $7.1 million over six fiscal
    years.</p> <p><b>Performance Audit and Fraud Prevention
    Expenditure and Cost Assumptions</b><br> The initiative directs
    the Washington State Auditor&#39;s Office to conduct performance
    audits of the long-term in-home care program biannually, which is
    assumed to be twice per year. Assuming the term &quot;long-term
    in-home care program&quot; has the same meaning as used in State
    Revenue Impacts above, the Auditor&#39;s Office estimates it will
    need three full-time auditors and incur travel and other costs to
    conduct the audits. This cost is estimated to be $2.1 million over
    six fiscal years.</p> <p>The initiative directs the state to hire
    five additional fraud investigators as part of the performance
    auditing process. Assuming the investigators will be hired by
    DSHS, this cost is estimated to be $2.5 million over six fiscal
    years.</p>' )

  :long_description => '<b>The Law as it Presently Exists</b><br> In Washington, the state sells and controls the distribution and sale of &ldquo;spirits.&rdquo; The term &ldquo;spirits&rdquo; refers to alcoholic beverages also called &ldquo;hard liquor&rdquo; (whiskies, vodka, gin, etc.). Spirits include beverages containing distilled alcohol and wines exceeding twenty-four percent alcohol by volume. Spirits do not include lower alcohol content beverages such as flavored malt beverages, beer, or wines containing less than twenty-four percent alcohol by volume.<br> &nbsp;<br> In Washington, spirits are sold at retail at state-run liquor stores and at &ldquo;contract liquor stores.&rdquo; Contract liquor stores are private businesses that sell spirits and other liquor under a contract with the state. Washington has approximately 165 state liquor stores and 160 contract liquor stores.<br> &nbsp;<br> The Washington State Liquor Control Board (&ldquo;the Board&rdquo;) operates the state liquor stores and oversees the contract liquor stores. Among its responsibilities, the Board regulates liquor advertising in the state. The Board, however, cannot advertise liquor sales.<br> &nbsp;<br> The Board sets the price for spirits sold at state-run and contract liquor stores based on the wholesale cost of the spirits, taxes, and a markup authorized by statute. The Board also collects the taxes imposed on the retail sale of spirits, and collects license fees and penalties. The proceeds received from the sale of spirits, the tax revenues on spirits, and license fees are distributed to cities, counties, and the state. Certain revenues are dedicated to funding programs addressing alcohol and drug abuse treatment and prevention.<br> &nbsp;<br> In Washington, manufacturers and suppliers of spirits may only sell spirits to the Board. The Board acts as the sole distributor of spirits sold in the state liquor stores and contract liquor stores, and sold by restaurants and certain other licensed sellers. Under a law effective June 15, 2011, the state must examine whether to lease the state&rsquo;s liquor distribution facilities to a private party, and whether such a lease would produce better financial returns for the state.<br> &nbsp;<br> Existing law allows private parties to sell or distribute alcoholic beverages that are not spirits, such as wine or beer. Wine and beer sellers are licensed by the state. There are different licenses for each of &ldquo;three tiers&rdquo; of the wine and beer business: (1) manufacturing; (2) distribution; and (3) retail sales. Existing law regulates the financial relationships and business transactions allowed between manufacturers, distributors, and retailers. While there are some exceptions, retailers are allowed to purchase wine or beer only from distributors. Similarly, distributors are allowed to purchase only from manufacturers, with certain exceptions.<br> &nbsp;<br> Existing law requires wine and beer manufacturers and distributors to maintain published price lists and offer the same price to every buyer. This requirement of uniform pricing prevents manufacturers or distributors from selling wine or beer at discounted prices to select customers, such as a quantity discount or other business reason for a discount. Existing law also requires wine and beer retailers to receive all wine and beer at their retail store and to not take delivery or store wine or beer at a separate warehouse location.<br> &nbsp;<br>  <b>The Effect of the Proposed Measure, if Approved</b><br> Initiative 1183 allows private parties to sell and distribute spirits, and alters the Liquor Control Board&rsquo;s powers and duties. It eliminates the Board&rsquo;s power to operate state liquor stores, to supervise the contract liquor stores, to distribute liquor, and to set the prices of spirits. Initiative 1183 directs the Board to close state liquor stores by June 1, 2012. It directs the Board to sell assets connected with liquor sales and distribution, and to sell at auction the right to operate a private liquor store at the location of any existing state liquor store. Initiative 1183 repeals a 2011 law that directed the state to examine the financial benefit of leasing the state liquor distribution facilities to a private party.<br> &nbsp;<br> Under Initiative 1183, qualifying private parties may obtain licenses to distribute spirits or to sell spirits at retail. A retail spirits license allows the retailer to sell spirits directly to consumers, and allows the sale of up to 24 liters of spirits for resale at a licensed premise, such as to a restaurant. Initiative 1183 allows private distributors to start selling spirits on March 1, 2012, and private retail spirits sales to start on June 1, 2012.<br> &nbsp;<br> To obtain a retail spirits license, a store must have at least 10,000 square feet of enclosed retail space in a single structure. However, Initiative 1183 also allows a retail spirits license for a store at the location of a former state liquor store or contract liquor store, even if the store is smaller than 10,000 square feet. It also allows smaller stores where there are no 10,000 square foot licensed spirits stores in the area. Initiative 1183 requires retail stores to participate in training their employees to prevent sales of alcohol to minors and inebriated persons.<br> &nbsp;<br> Initiative 1183 allows local governments and the public to provide input before issuance of a license to sell spirits. Initiative 1183 preserves local government power to zone and regulate the location of liquor stores.<br> &nbsp;<br> Initiative 1183 would not change the existing taxes on spirits. Initiative 1183 would require spirits retailers and distributors to pay license fees to the state. Retail stores would pay a fee of seventeen percent of gross revenues from spirits sales under the license, plus an annual $166 fee. Spirits distributors would pay an annual $1,320 fee, plus a percentage of gross revenues from spirits sales under the license. During the first two years of a spirits distributor license, the distributor license fee would be ten percent of the distributor&rsquo;s gross spirits sales. After two years, the spirits distributor fee would drop to five percent of the distributor&rsquo;s gross spirits sales.<br> &nbsp;<br> Initiative 1183 also requires that all persons holding spirits distributor licenses must have together paid a total of one hundred fifty million dollars in spirits distributor license fees by March 31, 2013. If the total license fees received from all distributor license holders is less than one hundred fifty million dollars, the Board must collect additional spirits distributor license fees to make up the difference. This additional fee would be allocated among the persons who held a spirits distributor license at any time before March 31, 2013.<br> &nbsp;<br> In addition to existing laws controlling the distribution of moneys received by the Board, a portion of fees from retail spirits licenses and spirits distributor licenses would be distributed to border areas, counties, and cities to enhance public safety programs.<br> &nbsp;<br> Initiative 1183 also changes laws that regulate the retailers, distributors, and manufacturers of wine. Initiative 1183 eliminates the requirement that distributors and manufacturers of wine sell at a uniform price, which would allow the sale of wine at different prices based on business reasons. Spirits could also be sold to different distributors and retailers at different prices. Beer manufacturers and distributors, however, would continue to be regulated by existing laws requiring uniform pricing. Under Initiative 1183, retailers could accept delivery of wine at a retail store or at a warehouse location. Under Initiative 1183, a store licensed to sell wine at retail may also obtain an endorsement allowing the store to sell to license holders who sell wine for consumption on the premise. For example, this would allow the store to sell wine to a restaurant that resells the wine by the glass or bottle to its customers.<p>',
  :additional_details => ' <p>The fiscal impact cannot be precisely estimated because the private market will determine bottle cost and markup for spirits.&nbsp;Using a range of assumptions, total State General Fund revenues increase an estimated $216 million to $253 million and total local revenues increase an estimated $186 million to $227 million, after Liquor Control Board one-time and ongoing expenses, over six fiscal years.&nbsp;A one-time net state revenue gain of $28.4 million is estimated from sale of the state liquor distribution center. One-time debt service costs are $5.3 million. Ongoing new state costs are estimated at $158,600 over six fiscal years.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>   <p><b>General Assumptions</b></p> <ul> <li>The initiative uses the term &#39;spirits&#39; to describe alcoholic beverages that are distilled instead of fermented. For purposes of the fiscal impact statement, the term &#39;liquor&#39; is used for &#39;spirits&#39; to maintain consistent terminology. Beer and wine are not spirits or liquor.</li>  <li>Estimates are described using the state&#39;s fiscal year (FY) of July 1 through June 30.</li>  <li>New liquor distributor licenses and new liquor retailer licenses are available beginning Feb. 8, 2012. There is no limit on the number of licenses that can be issued.&nbsp;</li>  <li>Liquor distributor licensees can begin making sales of liquor March 1, 2012. Liquor retailer licensees can begin making sales of liquor June 1, 2012.</li>  <li>By June 15, 2012, the state will no longer operate the state liquor distribution center or state liquor stores.</li>  <li>Estimates assume 1,428 licensed liquor retailers based on research from implementation of Substitute Senate Bill 6329 that authorized beer and wine tasting at grocery stores with a fully enclosed retail area of 9,000 square feet and the current number of state-operated and contract-operated liquor stores (328). The number of licenses is assumed to be constant for each fiscal year.&nbsp;</li>  <li>Estimates assume 184 licensed liquor distributors, based on the number of current Washington State Liquor Control Board (LCB) licensed beer and wine distributors, wine distributors, distilleries and liquor importers. The number of licenses is assumed to be constant for each fiscal year.&nbsp;</li>  <li>Estimates of impacts are measured against the June 2011 LCB revenue forecast (forecast).</li>  <li>Retail liquor liter sales are estimated to grow 5 percent from increased access to liquor. This assumption is based on an academic study and growth experienced in Alberta, Canada, after converting from state-operated liquor stores to private liquor stores. A decrease in liquor liter sales is estimated using the forecast price elasticity assumption of 0.49 percent. Price elasticity is a method used to calculate the change in consumption of a good when price increases or decreases. For every 1 percent increase/decrease in price, liquor liter sales increase/decrease 0.49 percent. Growth from increased access and price elasticity is in addition to normal 3 percent growth in liquor liter sales assumed in the forecast.</li> </ul>  <p><b>State and Local Revenues</b></p>  <p>Actual fiscal impacts depend on liquor bottle cost in the private market and the markup applied by both private liquor distributors and retailers. Therefore, there is a wide range of potential fiscal impacts.&nbsp;</p>   <p>To estimate gains or losses to the state and local governments, the fiscal impact statement used a model developed for prior initiatives, adjusted to reflect the content of this initiative.

The initiative imposes a new liquor retailer license fee of 17 percent of total liquor revenues beginning June 1, 2012.</li>  <li>Based on inventory information from the Retail Owners Institute, private liquor stores are estimated to maintain two months of liquor inventory. In contrast, state-operated liquor stores maintain 1.2 months of liquor inventory. Therefore, an additional 0.8 month of liquor liter sales to liquor <span class=GramE>retailers is assumed during FY 2012.&nbsp;</li>  <li>If the new liquor distributor license fee totals less than $150 million by March 31, 2013, these licensees must pay the difference between $150 million and actual receipts by May 31, 2013.

Both fees are due at the time of license renewal.&nbsp;</li>  <li>Liquor distributor licensees are assumed to be subject to the wholesaling business and occupation (B&amp;O) tax. Liquor retailer licensees are assumed to be subject to the retailing B&amp;O tax.&nbsp;</li>  <li>Liquor liter taxes and liquor sales taxes are amended by the initiative, but these changes are assumed not to increase, create or eliminate any tax.</li>  <li>Except for the loss of sales in state-operated liquor stores, estimates do not assume any change in pricing or volume of sales of beer and wine.</li>  <li>State-operated liquor stores sell Washington State Lottery products to the public. The estimate assumes 25 percent of these sales will be lost and remaining sales will occur in other outlets selling Washington State Lottery products. This revenue loss is estimated to be $1.8 million over six years.</li>  <li>Estimates of sales by current restaurant licensees who sell liquor at retail are limited to changes from price elasticity and the loss of the state&#39;s 15 percent quantity price discount to these licensees.</li>  <li>Estimates do not assume any change in sales by liquor stores operated on military bases. Such sales are assumed not to be subject to liquor liter taxes, liquor sales taxes or B&amp;O tax.</li>  <li>Estimates do not assume any change in sales by liquor stores operated by tribes. Such sales are assumed to be subject to liquor liter taxes and liquor sales taxes based on current agreements between tribes and LCB, but are not subject to B&amp;O tax.</li>  <li>No additional change is assumed for tax avoidance/non-compliance by consumers or migration of sales in and out of state by consumers. These items are assumed in the forecast price elasticity assumption.</li>  <li>Revenue from the state markup used to pay for the state liquor distribution center and state liquor store costs are netted to zero. The initiative eliminates both the revenue (markup) and the costs (state liquor distribution center and state liquor stores), which results in no additional revenue to the state.&nbsp;</li>  <li>The initiative requires new liquor distributor and retailer fees to be deposited into the Liquor Revolving Fund. The Liquor Revolving Fund is distributed by statute in the following order: <ol> <li>Payment of LCB administrative costs;</li>  <li>Distributions to state accounts for specific purposes (such as drug and alcohol research at the University of Washington and Washington State University);</li>  <li>Border areas (cities, towns and counties adjacent to the Canadian border); and</li>  <li>The  remainder after these distributions: a) 50 percent to the State General Fund; b) 10 percent to counties; and 3) 40 percent to cities and towns. </li> </ol> </li> </ul>  <p>Therefore, the model first reduces the Liquor Revolving Fund by LCB costs, one-time and ongoing, to determine total revenues distributed to the State General Fund and local governments. Other revenues (beer taxes, wine taxes, penalties, etc.) deposited into the Liquor Revolving Fund are assumed to be unaffected by the initiative and continue to be shared between the state and local governments.</p>  <p><b>Specific Local Government Revenue Assumptions</b></p>  <ul> <li>New liquor distributor and retailers license fees must be used to maintain, in the aggregate, Liquor Revolving Fund distributions to counties, cities, towns, border areas and the Municipal Research Service Center in an amount no less than the amount received in comparable periods. For purposes of the model, comparable period is measured by funds forecasted for calendar year 2011. The model estimates that local distributions will exceed the maintenance level required by the initiative each fiscal year.&nbsp;</li>  <li>An additional $10 million is also provided to counties, cities, towns and border areas.&nbsp;</li>  <li>Approximately 38 cities and towns impose a local B&amp;O tax. Using data from the Washington State Department of Revenue&#39;s 2008 Tax Reference Manual, total local B&amp;O tax is approximately 10 percent of total state B&amp;O tax. Assuming this ratio, $3 million is estimated as new local B&amp;O taxes from liquor sales over six fiscal years.</li>  <li>Total local government revenues are the sum of the increased Liquor Revolving Fund distributions, the additional $10 million and local B&amp;O tax.</li>  </ul>  <p><b>Specific State Asset Assumptions</b></p>  <p>The sale of the state liquor distribution center is estimated to generate a potential net $28.4 million in revenue. Because the sale date cannot be precisely determined, this revenue is stated separately and excluded from the total State General Fund revenue estimates in the first table above. The value of the state liquor distribution center is estimated to be $20.4 million, based on the King County Assessor&#39;s Office 2011 assessed value of the property. The sale of the equipment in the state liquor distribution center is estimated to be $8 million, based on the 2010 Washington State Auditor review, which assumed the sale of $16 million in assets would return about $8 million. Costs to sell the state liquor distribution center are estimated to total $1 million at the time of sale.&nbsp;</p>  <p>The initiative requires LCB to sell by public auction the right &#8212; at each state-owned store location &#8212; to operate a liquor store upon the premises without regard to the size of the premises if the applicant otherwise qualifies for a liquor retailer license. All state-operated liquor stores are leased and cannot be transferred or assigned. In addition, of the 166 state-operated liquor stores, 127 are located within one block of a grocery store. Because these factors (location, competition and lessor) will vary by state-operated liquor store and will affect the value of each operating right, revenue generated from the auction is indeterminate and not assumed in the model.&nbsp;</p>  <p>The initiative would repeal Engrossed Substitute Senate Bill 5942 (ESSB 5942), which directed the Office of Financial Management to conduct a competitive process for the selection of a private sector entity to lease and modernize the state&#39;s liquor warehousing and distribution facilities. Under ESSB 5942, if a proposal is determined to be in the best interests of the state by the Office of Financial Management after consultation with LCB and an advisory board created through the legislation, LCB may contract with that private entity for the lease of the state&#39;s liquor warehousing and distribution facilities. Because it is not known if LCB will enter into a contract, no revenue is assumed in the model.</p>  <p><b>State and Local Expenditure Estimate Assumptions</b></p>  <p>Revenue gains will accrue to existing accounts, the largest being the State General Fund, which may be used for any governmental purpose as appropriated by the Legislature.</p>  <p>Washington State Lottery proceeds in excess of expenses are deposited into the State Opportunity Pathways Account to support programs in higher education and early learning. Due to the loss of some lottery product sales in state liquor stores, it is estimated that funds to this account will decrease $1.8 million over six fiscal years.</p>  <p>Each county and city is required to spend 2 percent of its share of liquor revenues on alcohol and chemical dependency services, and these expenditures will increase. The additional $10 million distributed to cities, towns, counties and border areas are for enhancing public safety programs. The remaining revenue can be used for any allowable local government purpose.</p>  <p><b>State and Local Cost Estimate Assumptions</b></p>  <p>The fiscal impact statement does not estimate state costs or state savings due to social impacts from approval of the initiative. No costs are assumed for local governments.</p>  <p><b>Liquor Control Board Costs</b></p>  <p>Estimated one-time and ongoing LCB costs are assumed to be paid by the Liquor Revolving Fund.&nbsp; Therefore, payment of the following costs is reflected in the State General Fund revenue estimate.</p>  <p>LCB ongoing costs for licensing, enforcement and administration are estimated to increase by $350,000 for new fee-collection costs and implementing the &#39;responsible vendor program.&#39;&nbsp; No state costs from increased enforcement activities are assumed in the estimate.</p>  <p>Assuming a closure date of June 15, 2012, LCB will incur one-time state costs associated with managing the closure of the state liquor distribution center and state liquor stores. There will be additional one-time costs for issuing new licenses. These state costs are estimated to total $28.7 million during FYs 2012 and 2013:</p> <ul> <li>Unemployment, sick leave and vacation buyout costs for state employees estimated at $11.8 million.</li>  <li>Information technology changes and staff to issue new licenses estimated at $2.7 million.</li>  <li>Staffing costs to coordinate the sale of existing inventory, termination of contract store leases, surplus of store fixtures and auction of state-operated store operating rights estimated at $11 million.</li>  <li>Final audits of each state and contract liquor store estimated at $1.9 million.</li>  <li>Project management and additional human resource staff estimated at $1.3 million.</li> </ul>  <p><b>Department of Revenue Costs</b></p>  <p>The Washington State Department of Revenue will administer the collection of liquor excise tax from licensed liquor distributors and retailers. Costs include additional staff, information technology changes, rule-making and policy activities, taxpayer mailings and workshops, supplies and materials. Total one-time state costs are estimated to total $120,100 during FY 2012. Ongoing costs are estimated to be $38,500 each fiscal year beginning FY 2013.&nbsp;</p>   <p><b>State Indebtedness</b></p>  <p>There is $5.3 million in debt service costs for a Certificate of Participation bond for the state liquor distribution center that is scheduled to be paid by Dec. 1, 2013. This one-time state cost is assumed in FY 2014.</p> '

    and Education Committee, the Superintendent of the School
    District, a member of the School Board, and eight community
    members.&nbsp; This committee will make recommendations on the
    above-referenced plan and review programs and advise the City
    Council on proposed levy expenditures and reallocations to be
    adopted in the City&rsquo;s annual budget.<br> &nbsp;<br> In 1990,
    1997, and in 2004 Seattle voters approved &ldquo;Families and

    and out of school.&nbsp; The 1990 and 1997 levies each totaled
    $69,000,000 over seven years.&nbsp; The 2004 levy totaled
