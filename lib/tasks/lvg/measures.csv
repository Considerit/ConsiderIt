Initiative measures petitioning the legislature to enact a proposed measure can be filed with the Secretary of State starting ten months before the legislature's next regular session. After the Secretary of State accepts the initial filing of the measure, initiative supporters may begin collecting petition signatures.</p><p>To have an initiative submitted for a statewide vote of the people or to the legislature, the initiative sponsor must submit petitions to the Secretary of State containing the number of valid signatures required by the Washington State Constitution. Washington law provides that petitions must state the initiative measure in full and contain a place for each petitioner to sign and print their name and the address at which they are registered to vote. Petitions must contain a statement affirming that each person signing does so personally as a Washington voter, is providing correct information, has signed only once, and does so truthfully. The law also requires petitions to contain the signature of the petition circulator, swearing or acknowledging that to the best of his or her knowledge, voters signed the petition freely and without compensation, that to the best of his or her knowledge the information provided by the signors is true and correct, and acknowledging that forging a signature or providing compensation to induce people to sign is illegal. The Secretary of State must reject a signed initiative petition if it does not have the required information, has insufficient signatures, or is filed too late.</p><p>In addition to statewide initiatives to the people and initiatives to the legislature, Washington law allows some types of local governments to allow for the filing of local initiatives and to set the requirements for submitting such initiatives.</p><p>Under current law, those gathering signatures for petitions and those signing petitions receive the same protection from harassment or assault as anyone else, but no further protection. Washington law provides that a person is guilty of harassment if they threaten to: cause bodily injury to another person, damage another person's property, restrain any person, or do any other act intended to substantially harm the threatened person's physical or mental health or safety. Washington's statutes and common law also prohibit assaulting another person with unlawful force and the intent to inflict bodily harm, regardless of whether bodily harm occurs. Assault also includes an act, done with unlawful force, with the intent of causing another person to fear bodily injury, if the act actually does create reasonable apprehension and imminent fear of bodily injury. The crime of stalking is committed if a person intentionally and repeatedly harasses or repeatedly follows a person with intent to frighten, intimidate, or harass the person, or with knowledge that the person is afraid, intimidated, or harassed. A person is guilty of disorderly conduct if the person uses abusive language and thereby creates a risk of assault, intentionally disrupts any lawful assembly, or obstructs vehicular or pedestrian traffic without lawful authority.</p><h3>The Effect of the Proposed Measure, if Approved</h3><p>This measure would increase the time for gathering petition signatures by up to six months. Proposed initiative measures for a statewide vote of the people could be filed with the Secretary of State starting sixteen months before the election at which the voters would consider the measure. Proposed initiative measures petitioning the legislature to enact a measure could be filed starting sixteen months prior to the legislature's next regular session at which the measure would be considered.</p><p>Any statewide initiative to the people or local initiative that received the required number of petition signatures in the required timeframe would have to be submitted to a vote of the people at the next election. Local government officials would be required to submit the initiative to a vote regardless of the subject matter of the initiative measure.</p><p>The measure would provide that interfering with signature gathering for a state or local initiative or referendum is illegal. Interfering with a person trying to sign a petition, stalking a person who signs a petition, or stalking or retaliating against a person who gathers petition signatures would constitute the misdemeanor of disorderly conduct. Such conduct would be subject to the civil anti-harassment procedures available under RCW 10.14, and civil penalties. Interfering with petition signing and signature gathering would be defined to include, but not limited to, pushing, shoving, touching, spitting, throwing objects, yelling, screaming, being verbally abusive, or other tumultuous conduct, blocking or intimidating, or maintaining an intimidating presence within twenty-five feet of a petition signer or signature gatherer. Initiative or referendum petition signing and signature gathering would be legally protected on public sidewalks and walkways and all sidewalks and walkways that carry pedestrians, including those in front of entrances and exits to stores, and inside or outside public buildings.</p>","<p>Written by the Office of Financial Management</p><p>Initiative 517 (I-517) makes changes to the state and local government initiative process. I-517 also provides that interfering with signature gathering for state or local initiatives or referenda is illegal. I-517 has no revenue, expenditure or cost impact on state government. There is no revenue impact on local governments from I-517. However, the expenditure and cost impacts to local governments are indeterminate.</p><h3>General Assumptions</h3><p><ul><li>The fiscal estimates contained in this fiscal impact statement are based, in part, on assumptions about the scope and legal effect of the ballot measure should it be enacted by the voters. Such assumptions are not intended to represent legal interpretation or conclusions of law.</li><li>I-517 is effective Dec. 5, 2013.</li><li>The term ""next election"" is assumed to mean the next general election as provided in RCW 29A.04.043.</li><li>No state or local government revenue impact is assumed if the initiative measure is approved.</li></ul></p><h3>State Expenditure and Cost Assumptions</h3><p>I-517 would increase the time for gathering initiative petition signatures by up to six months. The Secretary of State will need to reprogram the online filing system to require sponsors to indicate the year for which each initiative filing applies. No state expenditure or costs would be required for this task.</p><h3>Local Expenditure and Cost Assumptions</h3><p>The initiative power is not available to all local governments. Only counties that have adopted a charter form of government have the power of the initiative. The initiative power is also available only to first-class cities, commission cities and code cities (code cities must formally adopt these powers). Based on research by the Municipal Research and Service Center of Washington, an estimated six counties and 59 cities have initiative power.</p><p>If I-517 is approved by the voters, counties and cities with initiative power would be required to submit to a vote any initiative, regardless of its subject matter, that obtains the required number of valid voter signatures within the required timeframe. Counties and cities are required to pay for their proportionate share of costs in a general election. The cost to a county or city to certify a local initiative and place it on the ballot in a general election varies significantly. Costs vary by jurisdiction and election based on the number of registered voters in the jurisdiction, the number of measures and offices on the ballot and the methodology used by the county to apportion costs. Based on information provided by counties and cities, an average cost to verify an initiative signature is estimated at $0.80 per signature and an average general election cost is estimated at $1 per registered voter. However, there are no data to estimate the quantity or location of additional initiatives that may qualify for local elections if I-517 is approved, and therefore, the expenditure and cost impact on counties and cities is indeterminate.</p><p>Local governments may experience increased expenditures and costs related to the provision in I-517 that interfering with signature gathering for state or local initiatives or referenda is illegal. There are no data to estimate the annual number of law enforcement actions that may occur from this portion of the initiative, and therefore, the fiscal impact on counties and cities is indeterminate.</p>",https://wei.sos.wa.gov/agency/osos/en/press_and_research/PreviousElections/2013/General-Election/Documents/I-517_Complete_Text.pdf,,https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AiPcA_16fYztdHpzNEFEUUJUbDJFWndhUW5yb3hydGc#gid=0,,Statewide,wash_i_517,Should we require labeling of genetically-engineered foods?,Statewide,Initiative,522,"<p>This measure would require most raw agricultural commodities, processed foods, and seeds and seed stocks, if produced using genetic engineering, as defined, to be labeled as genetically engineered when offered for retail sale.</p> <p>Should this measure be enacted into law?</p>","<p>Written by the Office of the Attorney General</p><h3>The Law as it Presently Exists</h3><p>In general, federal law regulates the safety and quality of food shipped between states, while Washington law regulates the safety and quality of food produced and sold within the state. Both federal and state law identify and regulate foods that are ""misbranded"" or ""adulterated,"" but neither state nor federal law requires any specific labeling of foods produced using genetic engineering.</p><p>Under Washington law, the director of the state Department of Agriculture is authorized to condemn, seize, and destroy misbranded or adulterated foods and food items. Washington law defines food and food products as ""misbranded"" where labeling or packaging is false or misleading, and ""adulterated"" if they contain some added substance that is poisonous or harmful to health, or if they are contaminated, diseased, putrid, or otherwise unfit as food or injurious to health. State law imposes many specific labeling and packaging requirements and prohibitions for food and food products, but it does not require any specific labeling of genetically engineered foods. No provision of state law treats genetically engineered food as adulterated.</p><p>Washington law also authorizes the director of the state Department of Agriculture to stop the sale of mislabeled agricultural seeds, flower seeds, and vegetable seeds sold in Washington, and to condemn and seize the seeds if necessary. Seeds are considered to be misbranded if they are not accurately labeled in compliance with state law, but existing state law does not require that genetically engineered seeds be labeled as genetically engineered.</p><h3>The Effect of the Proposed Measure, if Approved</h3><p>The measure would impose labeling requirements on genetically engineered foods and seeds offered for retail sale in Washington. The measure defines ""genetically engineered"" to mean changes to genetic material produced through techniques that directly insert DNA or RNA into organisms or that use cell fusion techniques to overcome natural barriers to cell multiplication or recombination.</p><p>Beginning July 1, 2015, any food produced using ""genetic engineering"" that is not labeled as required in the measure would be considered ""misbranded."" The measure would require genetically engineered raw agricultural commodities to be labeled conspicuously with the words ""genetically engineered,"" and genetically engineered packaged processed foods would have to be labeled conspicuously with the words ""partially produced with genetic engineering"" or ""may be partially produced with genetic engineering."" The measure would exempt the following foods from the labeling requirements: alcoholic beverages; certified organic foods; foods not produced using genetic engineering, as certified by an approved independent organization; foods served in restaurants or in food service establishments; ""medical food""; and foods consisting of or derived from animals that have themselves not been genetically engineered, regardless of whether the animal has been fed any genetically engineered food; and processed foods produced using genetically engineered processing aids or enzymes. Processed foods containing small amounts of genetically engineered materials would be exempt until July 1, 2019.</p><p>Beginning July 1, 2015, the measure also would require that genetically engineered seeds and seed stock be labeled conspicuously with the words ""genetically engineered"" or ""produced with genetic engineering.""</p><p>The measure provides that its requirements are to be implemented and enforced by the state Department of Health, instead of the state Department of Agriculture, and would authorize the Department of Health to assess a civil penalty of up to one thousand dollars per day for each violation. The Department of Health, acting through the Attorney General, could bring an action in superior court to enjoin a person violating the measure. Separately, after giving sixty days notice, any private person could bring an action in superior court to enjoin a person violating the measure, and potentially recover costs and attorney fees for the action.</p>","<p>Written by the Office of Financial Management</p><p>The initiative authorizes the Washington State Department of Health to adopt rules necessary to implement the initiative. Beginning July 1, 2015, the initiative allows the Department of Health, through the Attorney General, to bring an action to enjoin violations of the initiative's requirement that most raw agricultural commodities, processed foods, seeds and seed stocks, if produced using genetic engineering, be labeled as genetically engineered when offered for retail sale. Known state agency implementation costs are estimated at $3,368,000 over six fiscal years. State and local revenue and costs from enforcement activities are indeterminate.</p><h3>General Assumptions</h3><p><ul><li>The fiscal estimates contained in this fiscal impact statement are based, in part, on assumptions about the scope and legal effect of the ballot measure should it be enacted by the voters.

However, the initiative's labeling requirements begin July 1, 2015.</li><li>Estimates are described using the state's fiscal year (FY) of July 1 through June 30.</li></ul></p><h3>State Revenue Assumptions</h3><p>The initiative would allow the Department of Health (DOH) to assess a civil penalty against any person violating the requirements of the initiative in an amount not to exceed one thousand dollars ($1,000) per day. Additional state revenue could be generated from filing fees for civil actions filed in county superior courts to enforce the initiative's requirements. As provided in RCW 36.18.025, 46 percent of county superior court filing fees must be remitted to the State Treasurer for deposit in the state general fund and 54 percent of fees remain with the county. There are no data to estimate the annual number of civil actions or civil penalties that may be generated. Therefore, the state revenue impact from the initiative is indeterminate.</p><h3>State Expenditure and Cost Assumptions</h3><p>DOH program development will include expenditures for rule making, inspection and compliance, as well as education and technical assistance to the food industry. The cost of these expenditures over six fiscal years is estimated at $2,168,000. Beginning July 1, 2015, DOH will contract with a private laboratory for product sampling and testing as required in the initiative. Total cost of this expenditure over six fiscal years is estimated at $1,200,000.
