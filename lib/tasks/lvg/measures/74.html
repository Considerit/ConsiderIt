<P style="LINE-HEIGHT: normal; MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt" class=MsoNormal><SPAN style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Arial','sans-serif'; FONT-SIZE: 10pt">Washington law currently provides that marriage is a civil contract between a male and a female, who are both at least eighteen years old and otherwise capable of marrying. The law prohibits marriage if the parties to the marriage are of the same sex or are closely related, or if a party to the marriage is already married to somebody else. A marriage is void if one of the parties is under age seventeen, unless a superior court judge waives the age requirement based on a showing of necessity. A marriage entered into in another state or jurisdiction is recognized as valid unless Washington law would have prohibited the marriage if it had been formed here.<o:p></o:p></SPAN></P>

Two individuals of the same sex may enter into a state-registered domestic partnership if they meet certain requirements. Two individuals may also enter into a state-registered domestic partnership if at least one of them is over 62 years old. The other requirements for entering a domestic partnership are that the couple share a residence, are both at least eighteen years old, are not closely related, and neither is married or in a domestic partnership with anyone else. A legal union of two persons that was validly formed in another state or jurisdiction, and that is similar to a domestic partnership, is recognized as a domestic partnership in Washington.<o:p></o:p></SPAN></P>

The terms spouse, marriage, marital, husband, wife, widow, widower, next of kin, and family, when used in state statutes, apply equally to state-registered domestic partnerships as well as to marital relationships and married persons. Similarly, laws about dissolution and invalidation of marriage apply equally to state-registered domestic partnerships. Gender-specific terms such as husband and wife used in any statute, rule, or other law are construed to be gender neutral, and applicable to individuals in state-registered domestic partnerships.<o:p></o:p></SPAN></P>

No religious organization, or religiously-affiliated educational institution, would be required to provide accommodations, facilities, advantages, privileges, services, or goods related to the performance of a marriage. Clergy, religious organizations, and religiously-affiliated educational institutions would be immune from any civil claim or cause of action, including a claim or cause of action based on the Washington Law Against Discrimination, based on a refusal to perform or recognize any marriage, or to provide facilities, advantages, privileges, services, or goods related to the performance of a marriage.<o:p></o:p></SPAN></P>

It would also recognize certain legal unions between two persons, other than marriages, entered into in another state or jurisdiction. This provision applies if the legal union provides substantially the same rights, benefits, and responsibilities as a marriage, but does not meet the definition of a domestic partnership in Washington. Washington law would then treat such couples as having the same rights and responsibilities as married spouses in this state, unless the relationship is otherwise prohibited by Washington law or the couple does not marry within one year of becoming permanent residents of Washington. Two individuals would not be prohibited from obtaining a marriage license in Washington on the basis that they validly entered into a legal union, other than a marriage, in another state or jurisdiction.<o:p></o:p></SPAN></P>

The parties to existing same-sex domestic partnerships may either get married or dissolve their domestic partnership. Same-sex domestic partnerships, in which neither party is over 62 years old, will be automatically converted into a marriage as of June 30, 2014, unless the parties either get married or dissolve the domestic partnership before that date. The Secretary of State would be required to send letters to each same-sex domestic partner advising of these changes.<o:p></o:p></SPAN></P>

Committed same-sex couples are our neighbors, our friends and family, our co-workers. They should have the freedom to marry and build their lives together, without government interference. It’s not for us to judge, or to deny them that opportunity. </FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=2 face=Arial><STRONG>Treat Everyone as We Want to Be Treated</STRONG> <BR>Think of your own reasons for wanting to marry - you can imagine why same-sex couples dream of the happiness, security and responsibility of marriage. Same-sex couples may seem different, but when you talk with a committed same-sex couple, you realize they hope to marry for similar reasons as everyone else - to share and build a life together, to be there for each other, in good times and bad, in sickness and in health, and to make that special vow before family and friends to be together forever. </FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=2 face=Arial><STRONG>Vote Approve to Protect Religious Freedom</STRONG> <BR>We are all God's children. This law guarantees religious freedom and won't change how each religion defines marriage. It protects the rights of clergy, churches, and religious organizations that don't perform or recognize same-sex marriages.</FONT></P>

                                <P><FONT size=2 face=Arial>Marriage is more than a commitment between two loving people. It was created to benefit the next generation. Traditional marriage promotes child well-being because kids need both a mother and a father. Extensive social science shows that children do best when raised by their married parents.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=2 face=Arial>The new marriage law passed by legislators did not enact same-sex marriage – it redefined marriage for all, stripping it of its essential man/woman nature and tossing common-sense out the window. Women can now be “husbands” and men can be “wives.”</FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=2 face=Arial><STRONG>Our “Everything But Marriage” Law Already Provides Gays Full Legal Equality</STRONG> <BR>Washington same-sex couples already enjoy full legal equality. The new marriage legislation did not provide any new substantive legal rights for gay couples. </FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=2 face=Arial><STRONG>Redefining marriage has consequences.</STRONG> <BR>God’s creation of marriage as the union of one man and one woman is the foundation of society and has served us well for thousands of years. People who disagree with this new definition could find themselves facing sanctions, as has occurred elsewhere. Church groups have lost their tax exemptions. Small businesses were sued. Wedding professionals have been fined. Charities opposing gay marriage were forced to end services. Young children were taught about gay marriage in public school.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=2 face=Arial>Gays and lesbians are entitled to respect and to live as they choose, but they don’t have a right to redefine marriage. Being opposed to same-sex marriage doesn’t mean you dislike gays and lesbians. It means you support traditional marriage. Please <I style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">reject</I> R-74 to <I style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">reject</I> redefining marriage.</SPAN></P></FONT>

Same-sex partners shouldn't be denied access to their loved one in emergencies because they aren't married. The American Academy of Pediatrics agrees legalizing same-sex marriage promotes healthy families and children. Washington State Psychological Association and Children's Alliance approve R-74. This law doesn't change existing anti-discrimination laws or schools. Lawsuits haven't increased in states with same-sex marriage. Liberty and pursuit of happiness are core American values.</FONT>
