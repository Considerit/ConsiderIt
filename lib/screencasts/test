#####
# Uses castanaut to automate a screencast in safari. The robot voice sections, 
# as created via while_saying, help to space out the video for timing
# purposes. 
#
#
# Installation:
#   - must be installed on a mac
#   - Castanaut should be installed from https://github.com/tkriplean/castanaut
#
# Execution:
#   - must be run on a mac
#   - /path/to/castanaut/bin/castanaut /path/to/this/file
#   - can be invoked from bin/screencast, but the path to in bin/screencast is
#     hardcoded for Travis...talk to him if you can't get it to run.  

# TODO: 
#  - refactor into general methods so we can create other screencasts or tests
#    more easily
#  - find a way to automatically destroy any opinions created here.

# Prep for this screencast: 
# 
# > rake prep_deathstar

# By default, this script will only launch and control a safari instance. 
# Setting 'record_video' will also cause a screen recording to be created.
