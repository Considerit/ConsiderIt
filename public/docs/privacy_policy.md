Consider.it Privacy Policy
================================
Updated: February 2023


This privacy policy outlines how we handle the data you entrust to us. We want you to understand how and why Consider.it LLC (“Consider.it”, “we”, or “us”) collects, uses and shares information about you when you access and use Consider.it’s site and services (collectively, the “Services”) or when you otherwise interact with us.

And we want you to understand your rights to your data. **Your data continues to be owned by you.** Not us, nor your forum host.

Furthermore, we want to emphasize our promise to you that **we will never sell your data to third parties**, such as for targeted advertising or to a data aggregator. 

Throughout this policy, we make reference to Forum Hosts (or "Hosts"). In our Services, Forum Hosts are the people (who may or may not be representing an organization) who create a new Consider.it forum, who control the configuration of that forum, and who make other administrative decisions (e.g. content moderation). In addition to these [Terms of Service](/docs/legal/terms_of_service), Forum Hosts are bound by our [Forum Hosting Terms](/docs/legal/standard_hosting_terms).

Information we collect about you
--------------------------------

Information we collect about you may include, depending on the service:

### Information regarding your account

We collect the information you provide when you use our Services. This includes basic information used to create your account (e.g., a username, password, email address, and profile picture). 

An email address is collected to (1) make it harder for someone to register multiple accounts, (2) give a unique identifier to an account, and (3) provide a way for Consider.it to send email notifications about subsequent activity in the forum. There are other less common ways in which we may use your email address to perform our services, such as reaching out to you if we discover that an error in Consider.it software interferred with your ability to participate in a forum. 

### Other information you may provide at the Forum Host's request
<a name="host-questions"></a>

The Forum Host (or Hosts) of a particular Consider.it forum may configure additional optional or required questions to ask you during the account registration process. For example, demographic questions like your age, gender, race, or income. This information can help hosts for a number of reasons, such as understanding if they're reaching the communities they're seeking to engage or understanding differences in how subgroups are responding to particular proposals.  

The Forum Host chooses whether the information provided for each question is visible only to the Hosts of the forum or whether the information is visible to anyone who participates in the forum. 

At any point, you can edit your responses to these questions in your user profile. However, if a Host specifies that a question is required for your participation, it must be answered. You can, however, withdraw from the forum by [deleting your account](/docs/legal/deleting_your_data) (also an option in your profile).

If you feel that a Forum Host is asking inappropriate and/or intrusive questions without a reasonable way to opt-out, please report it to [help@consider.it](mailto:help@consider.it).

### Content you share
<a name="content-you-share"></a>

Consider.it allows users to post content, including proposals, points, comments, photos, links and other materials. Anything that a user posts or otherwise makes available on our Services is referred to as “Content.” We collect the Content you post to the Services, such as opinions you give, the proposals, points and comments you write, both in public and in private Consider.it Forums. The opinions you submit by e.g. dragging sliders, is also considered posted Content.

### Geolocation data
<a name="geolocation-data"></a>

We log access to all accounts by full IP address so that we can verify no unauthorized access has happened recently. This login data is deleted after our logs are rotated out. This takes no more than a year. We also may log full IP addresses used to sign up for an account. 

Web analytics data, described in the next section, are also tied temporarily to IP addresses to assist with troubleshooting and for identifying coordinated or malicious network activity.

### Website interactions

When you browse our marketing pages or applications, your browser automatically shares certain information such as which operating system and browser version you are using. We track that information, along with the pages you are visiting, page load timing, and which website referred you for statistical purposes like conversion rates and to test new designs. We sometimes track specific link clicks to help inform some design decisions. These web analytics data are tied to a truncated version of your IP address and, when you are signed into our Services, your user account.

### Anti-bot measures
<a name="anti-bot-measures"></a>

We may use [CAPTCHA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CAPTCHA) services to reduce the risk of bot-based attacks on our system (spamming, multiple account creation to hijack a forum, and brute force login). We have a legitimate interest in protecting our apps and the broader Internet community from these attacks. When we implement CAPTCHAs during account registration, the CAPTCHA service will take various information into account when decided whether the data is likely to be filled out by an automated program (e.g IP address, how long the visitor has been on the app, mouse movements).

### Cookies

A cookie is a piece of text stored by your browser to help it remember your login information, site preferences, and more. **In Consider.it, we only use persistent first-party cookies for storing session data** (i.e. a logged-in account so you don't have to login each time you visit the Site or refresh the page). All other cookies are strictly opt-in.

You can adjust cookie retention settings in your own browser. To learn more about cookies, including how to view which cookies have been set and how to manage and delete them, please visit: [www.allaboutcookies.org](https://www.allaboutcookies.org).

### Voluntary correspondence

If you contact us with a question or to ask for help, or respond to an inquiry by us, we keep that correspondence, including the email address, so that we have a history of past correspondences to reference if you reach out in the future.

### Billing information

If you decide to pay for a Consider.it product, we ask for your credit card and billing address. That’s so we can charge you for service, calculate taxes due, and send you invoices. Your name, billing address, organization name, billing information, and credit card information is handled by our payment processor.

### Information we do not collect

We don’t collect any characteristics of protected classifications including age, race, gender, religion, sexual orientation, gender identity, gender expression, or physical and mental abilities or disabilities **unless a Forum Host configures a forum to do so during the account registration mini-survey**. In that case, you may provide this data voluntarily, or not use that forum.

We also do not collect any biometric data. You may choose to provide a profile picture that is a real picture of you, but that is your choice. We do not derive any information from profile pictures, they are just used to enliven the forum.

### Children Under the Age of 13

Our Services are not intended for children under 13 years of age. No one under age 13 may provide any information to or on the Services. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13. If you are under 13, do not use or provide any information on these Services or on or through any of its features/register on the Services, make any purchases through the Services, use any of the interactive or public comment features of the Services or provide any information about yourself to us, including your name, address, telephone number, email address, or any screen name or user name you may use.

If we learn we have collected or received personal information from a child under 13 without verification of parental consent, we will delete that information. If you believe we might have any information from or about a child under 13, please contact us at [hello@consider.it](mailto:hello@consider.it).



How we use information about you
--------------------------------

We believe the following is a complete accounting of how we use information about you. However, because unexpected situations do arise, we do not claim that the following is an exhaustive list of how we use your personal data. 


### Provide and maintain the Services

As a dialogue and deliberation platform, we store and process Content you share in the forum, including proposals, comments, opinions, files, and images. We continue to store and process this Content until either you [delete your account](/docs/legal/deleting_your_data), you delete your data on a particular forum, or the forum host requests the forum to be deleted. 

We also store and process your user profile, including your name, email address, profile photo, and password. This information can make a user personally identifiable, although you can use a pseudonym and anonymous email address to prevent this. Your password is never stored in cleartext; rather, it is [salted and hashed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salt_(cryptography)) so that no one can deduce your password. 

### To improve the Services

Sometimes we use your data to help us fix software errors, either that we discover ourselves, that are reported to us by you or others, or that are identified through a machine-generated notification of an error. In some cases we will access your email address to communicate with you about an error we can see you experienced. 

We also use forum data in our software development environments so that we can develop new functionality. The forum data we use is anonymized: names, email addresses, and other personal information is randomized. We only use forum data from our US-based server.

### To protect the safety of Consider.it and our users

This includes, but is not limited to, blocking suspected [spammers](#geolocation-data), [bots](#anti-bot-measures), addressing abuse, and enforcing the [Terms of Service](/docs/legal/terms_of_service). If we do discover you are using our products for a [restricted purpose](/docs/legal/use_restrictions), we may report the incident to the appropriate authorities.

### Promote our Services using Content that you share in public forums

This mainly means that in the course of marketing our Services, we reserve the right to link to a public forum in which you participated. 

We will not specifically quote any content you have shared in a forum without asking your permission and receiving written consent. 

### Other uses
* Send you technical notices, updates, security alerts, and other support and administrative messages
* Communicate with you about Consider.it news and information we think be of interest to you
* Monitor and analyze trends, usage, and activities in connection with our Services


How we share information
------------------------

We don't sell your information to third parties. Our business model is to get paid by Forum Hosts to help them engage their communities. It is a straightforward relationship. 

We believe the following is a complete accounting of how we share information about you with other entities. However, because unexpected situations do arise, we do not claim that the following is an exhaustive list of how we share your personal data. 


### While providing the Services

In the course of providing dialogue and deliberation Services, certain information will be shared with other users and the public. 

In public Forums, proposals, points, comments, usernames, and other Content you post are viewable by the public at large. 

In private Forums, proposals, points, comments, usernames and other Content you post are only viewable by invited members of the respective private Forum. In order to enter a private Forum, a user must log in with his or her proper credentials. Note that Hosts can at a later time turn a private forum into a public forum. You should take that into consideration before posting Content to the Services. 

Any data collected by the Host during registration that they have marked as visible to other forum users is also accessible to those other forum users. 

We also store and process your user profile. Your email address will only be shared, [under some conditions](#sharing-data-with-hosts), with the hosts of the forum, and never with other users or visitors to the forum, unless you explicitly enter your email address into a field where we're not asking for an email address. 

#### Subprocessors 

Though we try to keep it to a minimum, we do use some third-party services to carry out our Services (e.g. our hosted server provider). These services may process information you provided during the registration process or content you post. You can view the [list of third-party services we use](/docs/legal/subprocessors). We also use some other processors for some business functions (like our email provider), which you can see at [the same link](/docs/legal/subprocessors).


### When sharing data with Forum Hosts

<a name="sharing-data-with-hosts"></a>

A Host of a paid Consider.it forum is considered a first-party to the data we collect on their behalf in the respective forum. Specifically, we give Hosts of paid forums the option to export data containing (a) Content created in the Forum, linked to the account information of the user who created it and (b) Account information about users of the forum including but not limited to demographic data and personal contact information; and (c) other related data.

Note that [Forum Hosts have additional use restrictions](/docs/legal/use_restrictions#additional-restrictions-for-hosts), including a restriction to not sell Personal Data collected from Consider.it's export data functionality to a third party. 

#### Public Records

If the Host is a government entity or other public body, any communication via the Services (whether by a government representative, your, or the general public) may be considered a “public record” in the jurisdiction of the Host, and, as such, may be subject to monitoring and retention by the Host, and disclosure to third parties.

### When required under applicable law

Consider.it is based in the U.S., and also has data infrastructure in the EU and Canada. There are circumstances in which Consider.it will divulge your Personal Information when formally required by law, regulation, or litigation. If we are audited by a tax authority, we may be required to share billing-related information. If that happens, we only share the bare minimum needed such as billing addresses and tax exemption information.


Data retention
--------------

We continue to retain data that you provide to a forum until the Forum Host terminates their agreement with us, or until you [delete your account or delete your data for a particular forum](/docs/legal/deleting_your_data). This is because often a Consider.it forum continues to serve as a transparent public account for a community about what its members think about the topics discussed, one of the primary value propositions of our Services. 


How we secure your data
-----------------------

We take reasonable measures to help protect information about you from loss, theft, misuse and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, and destruction. For example, we do not directly store your password on our server; instead we store a salted password that is then encrypted using a cryptographic hash function.

Location of data
----------------

Forum Hosts have the option to create the respective forum on our infrastructure primarily based in either the US, the EU, or Canada. This impacts the primary location where we store and process your data. For example, if the forum you're participating in is hosted in the EU, our cloud computing services are all also based in the EU. See our [subprocessors](/docs/legal/subprocessors) for more information. 

So please be aware that any information you provide to us will be transferred to, stored, and processed in the location of the regional service. By using our service, participating in any of our services and/or providing us with your information, you consent to this transfer.


Your rights regarding your personal data
----------------------------------------

We strive to uphold the data rights for all Consider.it users, regardless of your location, articulated in the most stringent privacy regulations around the world, specifically the EU's [General Data Protection Regulation](https://gdpr-info.eu/) (GDPR) and the [California Consumer Privacy Act](https://oag.ca.gov/privacy/ccpa) (CCPA). We recognize all the rights granted in these regulations, except as limited by applicable law. The rights are:

*   **The right to be informed.** You have the right to know what personal information is collected, used, shared or sold. We outline both the categories and some specific data we collect, as well as how they are used, in this privacy policy. You also have the right to know the data retention policy. 
*   **The right of access.** This includes your right to access the personal information we gather about you, and your right to obtain information about the sharing, storage, security and processing of that information.
*   **The right to correction.** You have the right to request prompt correction of your personal information. This is almost always possible by editing your user profile, but if not, you can contact us.
*   **The right to object to processing.** You have the right to object to how or why your personal information is processed, in some circumstances.
*   **The right to not be subject to automated decision-making.** You have the right to object and prevent any decision that could have a legal, or similarly significant, effect on you from being made solely based on automated processes. This right is limited, however, if the decision is necessary for performance of any contract between you and us, is allowed by applicable law, or is based on your explicit consent.
*   **The right to be forgotten.** This is your right to request, subject to certain limitations under applicable law, that your personal information be erased from our possession and, by extension, all of our service providers. Fulfillment of some data deletion requests may prevent you from using our services because our applications may then no longer work. In such cases, a data deletion request may result in closing your account.
*   **The right to portability.** You have the right to receive the personal information we have about you and the right to transmit it to another party.
*   **The right to restrict processing.** This is your right to request restriction of how and why your personal information is used or processed, including opting out of sale of personal information (which we never have and never will do).
*   **The right to non-discrimination.** We do not and will not charge you a different amount to use our products, offer you different discounts, or give you a lower level of customer service because you have exercised your data privacy rights. However, the exercise of certain rights (such as the right “to be forgotten”) may prevent you from using our Services.
*   **The right to complain.** You have the right to make a complaint regarding our handling of your personal information with the appropriate supervisory authority. 

You can exercise many of these rights by directly editing information or taking action in your user profile, and by reading this Privacy Policy, [Terms of Service](/docs/legal/terms_of_service), and the other linked documents. 

You may also exercise the above rights by contacting us at [help@consider.it](mailto:help@consider.it) and provide specific and detailed information about your request necessary for us to respond to and carry out your request. Note that if an authorized agent is corresponding on your behalf, we will first need written consent with a signature from the account holder before proceeding.

**If you wish to register a complaint, please contact us at [help@consider.it](mailto:help@consider.it).** Alternatively, if you are in the EU, you can [identify your specific authority to file a complaint or find out more about GDPR](https://edpb.europa.eu/about-edpb/board/members_en).


### Accessing, Correcting, or Deleting Your Information

You can access, review, and change your personal information by logging into Services and visiting your user profile page. You can also delete your account from your user profile page. More information is available about [accessing, correcting, or deleting your information](/docs/legal/deleting_your_data), and that information is part of this privacy policy. 


When transferring personal data from the EU
-------------------------------------------

The GDPR requires that any data transferred out of the EU must be treated with the same level of protection that the EU privacy laws grant. We have worked hard to minimize the times when EU personal data is transferred out of the EU by (1) minimizing our subprocessors (organizations with whom we task with carrying out data processing) and (2) working with subprocessors with operations in the EU. You can inspect our subprocessors and where their operations are, in our [subprocessor documentation](/docs/legal/subprocessors). 

To cover the few cases where your personal data may be transferred out of the EU, Consider.it offers a [Data Processing Addendum](/docs/legal/data_processing_addendum) (DPA) to protect it. This DPA is incorporated into our [Forum Host Terms of Service](/docs/legal/standard_hosting_terms) to govern our processing of your data on behalf of the Forum Host (the data controller). The DPA includes the European Commission’s updated Standard Contractual Clauses to extend GDPR privacy principles, rights, and obligations everywhere personal data is processed. 

There are also a few ad-hoc cases where EU personal data may be transferred to the US related to Consider.it LLC operations. Such transfers are only occasional and transferred under the Article 49(1)(b) derogation under GDPR. These data transfers mostly occur through direct email correspondance with us, for example, if we respond to a support request from you. 



Changes
-------

We will change this Privacy Policy from time to time. When we do, we will revise the date at the top of the policy. As of January 2023, our legal policies will be available [on GitHub](https://github.com/Considerit/ConsiderIt/tree/master/public/docs), where you can review all changes that have been made over time. We encourage you to review the Privacy Policy whenever you access or use our Services or otherwise interact with us to stay informed about our information practices and the ways you can help protect your privacy. If you continue to use our Services after Privacy Policy changes go into effect, you consent to the revised policy.
