Taking into account the nature of the Processing, Consider.it shall assist Customer by appropriate technical and organizational measures, insofar as this is possible, for the fulfilment of Customer’s obligation to respond to a Data Subject Request under Data Protection Laws. In addition, to the extent Customer, in its use of the Services, does not have the ability to address a Data Subject Request, Consider.it shall upon Customer’s request provide commercially reasonable efforts to assist Customer in responding to such Data Subject Request, to the extent Consider.it is legally permitted to do so and the response to such Data Subject Request is required under Data Protection Laws. To the extent legally permitted, Customer shall be responsible for any costs arising from Consider.it’s provision of such assistance.

### 4. SUB-PROCESSORS

4.1 **Appointment of Sub-processors.** Customer acknowledges and agrees that (a) Consider.it’s Affiliates may be retained as Sub-processors; and (b) Consider.it and Consider.it’s Affiliates respectively may engage third-party Sub-processors in connection with the provision of the Services. Consider.it or a Consider.it Affiliate has entered into a written agreement with each Sub-processor containing data protection obligations not less protective than those in this DPA with respect to the protection of Customer Data to the extent applicable to the nature of the Services provided by such Sub-processor.


4.2 **List of Current Sub-processors and Notification of New Sub-processors.** Consider.it shall make available to Customer the current list of Sub-processors for Consider.it Services. Such Sub-processor lists shall include the identities of those Sub-processors (“Sub-processor Documentation”). Customer may find on Consider.it’s webpage at https://consider.it/docs/legal/subprocessors the Sub-processor Documentation. Consider.it, through notification to the Customer shall provide notification of a new Sub-processor(s) before authorizing any new Subprocessor(s) to Process Personal Data in connection with the provision of the applicable Services.

4.3 **Objection Right for New Sub-processors.** Customer may object to Consider.it’s use of a new Sub-processor by notifying Consider.it in writing within ten (10) business days after receipt of Consider.it’s notice in accordance with the mechanism set out in Section 6.2. In the event Customer objects to a new Sub-processor, Consider.it will use reasonable efforts to make available to Customer a change in the Services or recommend a commercially reasonable change to Customer’s configuration or use of the Services to avoid Processing of Personal Data by the objected-to new Sub-processor without unreasonably burdening the Customer. If Consider.it is unable to make available such change within a reasonable period of time, which shall not exceed thirty (30) days, Customer may terminate the applicable Agreement with respect only to those Services which cannot be provided by Consider.it without the use of the objected-to new Sub-processor by providing written notice to Consider.it. Consider.it will refund Customer any prepaid fees covering the remainder of the term of such Agreement following the effective date of termination with respect to such terminated Services, without imposing a penalty for such termination on Customer.

4.4 **Liability.** Consider.it shall be liable for the acts and omissions of its Sub-processors to the same extent Consider.it would be liable if performing the services of each Sub-processor directly under the terms of this DPA, except as otherwise set forth in the Agreement.


### 5. SECURITY

5.1 **Controls for the Protection of Personal Data.** Consider.it shall maintain appropriate technical and organizational measures for protection of the security (including protection against unauthorized or unlawful Processing and against accidental or unlawful destruction, loss or alteration or damage, unauthorized disclosure of, or access to, Personal Data), confidentiality and integrity of Personal Data, as set forth in the [Security Practices Documentation](/docs/legal/security). Consider.it will not materially decrease the overall security of the Services.

5.2 **Third-Party Audits.** 

5.2.1 Upon Customer’s written request at reasonable intervals, and subject to the confidentiality obligations set forth in the Agreement, Consider.it shall make available to Controller all information reasonably necessary to demonstrate compliance with its processing obligations and allow for and contribute to audits and inspections.

5.2.2 Any audit conducted under this DPA shall consist of examination of the most recent reports, certificates and/or extracts prepared by an independent auditor bound by confidentiality provisions similar to those set out in the Agreement. In the event that provision of the same is not deemed sufficient in the reasonable opinion of the Controller, the Controller may conduct a more extensive audit which shall be: (i) at the Controller’s expense; (ii) limited in scope to matters specific to the Controller and agreed in advance; (iii) carried out during the Processor’s usual business hours and upon reasonable notice which shall be not less than 4 weeks unless an identifiable material issue has arisen; and (iv) conducted in a way which does not interfere with the Processor’s day-to-day business.

5.2.3 This clause shall not modify or limit the rights of audit of the Controller, instead it is intended to clarify the procedures in respect of any audit undertaken pursuant thereto.

5.3 **Data Protection Impact Assessment.** Upon Customer’s request, Consider.it shall provide Customer with reasonable cooperation and assistance needed to fulfil Customer’s obligation under Data Protection Laws to carry out a data protection impact assessment related to Customer’s use of the Services, to the extent Customer does not otherwise have access to the relevant information, and to the extent such information is available to Consider.it. 

### 6. PERSONAL DATA INCIDENT MANAGEMENT AND NOTIFICATION

Consider.it shall, notify Customer without undue delay, and in compliance with applicable laws, after becoming aware of the accidental or unlawful destruction, loss, alteration, unauthorized disclosure of, or access to Personal Data, including Personal Data, transmitted, stored or otherwise Processed by Consider.it or its Sub-processors of which Consider.it becomes aware (a **“Personal Data Incident”**). Consider.it shall make reasonable efforts to identify the cause of such Personal Data Incident and take those steps as Consider.it deems necessary and reasonable in order to remediate the cause of such a Personal Data Incident to the extent the remediation is within Consider.it’s reasonable control. The obligations herein shall not apply to incidents that are caused by Customer or Customer’s Invited Users.



### 7. CONSIDER.IT PERSONNEL

7.1 **Confidentiality.** Consider.it shall ensure that its personnel engaged in the Processing of Personal Data are informed of the confidential nature of the Personal Data, have received appropriate training on their responsibilities and have executed written confidentiality agreements. Consider.it shall ensure that such confidentiality obligations survive the termination of the personnel engagement.

7.2 **Reliability.** Consider.it shall take commercially reasonable steps to ensure the reliability of any Consider.it personnel engaged in the Processing of Personal Data.

7.3 **Limitation of Access.** Consider.it shall ensure that Consider.it’s access to Personal Data is limited to those personnel performing Services in accordance with the Agreement.

7.4 **Data Protection Officer (DPO).** Consider.it has appointed Travis Kriplean as the DPO for Consider.it LLC. For questions about this DPA or any other privacy issues please send an email to [travis@consider.it](mailto:travis@consider.it).



### 8. RETURN AND DELETION OF PERSONAL DATA
Upon termination of the Services for which Consider.it is Processing Personal Data, Consider.it shall, upon Customer’s request, and subject to the limitations described in the Agreement and the Security Practices Documentation, return all Personal Data in Consider.it’s possession to Customer and/or securely destroy such Personal Data and demonstrate to the satisfaction of Customer that it has taken such measures, unless applicable law prevents it from returning or destroying all or part of Personal Data. For clarification, depending on the Service plan purchased by Customer, access to export functionality may incur additional charge(s) and/or require purchase of a Service upgrade. Until Personal Data is deleted or returned, Consider.it shall continue to comply with this DPA and its Schedules.


### 9. AUTHORIZED AFFILIATES

9.1 **Contractual Relationship.** The parties acknowledge and agree that, by entering into the DPA, the Customer enters into the DPA on behalf of itself and, as applicable, in the name and on behalf of its Authorized Affiliates, thereby establishing a separate DPA between Consider.it and each such Authorized Affiliates subject to the provisions of the Agreement and this Section 10. Each Authorized Affiliate agrees to be bound by the obligations under this DPA and, to the extent applicable, the Agreement. For the avoidance of doubt, by Customer entering into this DPA, an Authorized Affiliate is not and does not become a party to the Agreement, and is only a party to the DPA. All access to and use of the Services and Content by Authorized Affiliates must comply with the terms and conditions of the Agreement and any violation of the terms and conditions of the Agreement by an Authorized Affiliate shall be deemed a violation by Customer.

9.2 **Communication.** The Customer that is the contracting party to the Agreement shall remain responsible for coordinating all communication with Consider.it under this DPA and be entitled to make and receive any communication in relation to this DPA on behalf of its Authorized Affiliate.

9.3 **Rights of Authorized Affiliates.** Where an Authorized Affiliate becomes a party to the DPA with Consider.it, it shall to the extent required under applicable Data Protection Laws be entitled to exercise the rights and seek remedies under this DPA, subject to the following:

9.3.1 Except where applicable Data Protection Laws require the Authorized Affiliate to exercise a right or seek any remedy under this DPA against Consider.it directly by itself, the parties agree that (i) solely the Customer that is the contracting party to the Agreement shall exercise any such right or seek any such remedy on behalf of the Authorized Affiliate, and (ii) the Customer that is the contracting party to the Agreement shall exercise any such rights under this DPA not separately for each Authorized Affiliate individually but in a combined manner for all of its Authorized Affiliates together (as set forth, for example, in Section 10.3.2, below).

9.3.2 The parties agree that the Customer that is the contracting party to the Agreement shall, when carrying out an on-site audit of the procedures relevant to the protection of Personal Data, take all reasonable measures to limit any impact on Consider.it and its Sub-processors by combining, to the extent reasonably possible, several audit requests carried out on behalf of different Authorized Affiliates in one single audit.

### 10. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY

Each party’s and all of its Affiliates’ liability, taken together in the aggregate, arising out of or related to this DPA, and all DPAs between Authorized Affiliates and Consider.it, whether in contract, tort or under any other theory of liability, is subject to the limitations of liability set forth in the Agreement, and such limitations apply to the aggregate liability of that party and all of its Affiliates under the Agreement and all DPAs together.

For the avoidance of doubt, Consider.it’s and its Affiliates’ total liability for all claims from the Customer and all of its Authorized Affiliates arising out of or related to the Agreement and each DPA shall apply in the aggregate for all claims under both the Agreement and all DPAs established under this Agreement, including by Customer and all Authorized Affiliates, and, in particular, shall not be understood to apply individually and severally to Customer and/or to any Authorized Affiliate that is a contractual party to any such DPA.

Also for the avoidance of doubt, each reference to the DPA in this DPA means this DPA including its Schedules and Appendices.

### 11. EUROPEAN SPECIFIC PROVISIONS

11.1 **Definitions.** For the purposes of this section 11 and Schedule 1 these terms shall be defined as follows:
  * "EU C-to-P Transfer Clauses" means Standard Contractual Clauses sections I, II, III and IV (as applicable) to the extent they reference Module Two (Controller-to-Processor).
  * "EU P-to-P Transfer Clauses" means Standard Contractual Clauses sections I, II III and IV (as applicable) to the extent they reference Module Three (Processor-to-Processor).

11.2 **GDPR.** Consider.it will Process Personal Data in accordance with the GDPR requirements directly applicable to Consider.it's provisioning of the Services.

11.3 **Customer Instructions.** Consider.it shall inform Customer immediately (i) if, in its opinion, an instruction from Customer constitutes a breach of the GDPR and/or (ii) if Consider.it is unable to follow Customer's instructions for the Processing of Personal Data.

11.4 **Transfer Mechanisms.** If, in the performance of the Services, Personal Data that is subject to the GDPR or any other law relating to the protection or privacy of individuals that apply in Europe is transferred out of Europe to countries which do not ensure an adequate level of data protection within the meaning of the Data Protection Laws of Europe, the EU C-to-P Transfer Clauses shall apply and can be directly enforced by the parties to the extent such transfers are subject to the Data Protection Laws of Europe, subject to the additional terms in section 1 of Schedule 1.

11.5 **Impact of local laws.** As of the Effective Date, Consider.it has no reason to believe that the laws and practices in any third country of destination applicable to its Processing of the Personal Data as set forth in the Sub-processor Lists (https://consider.it/docs/legal/subprocessors), including any requirements to disclose personal data or measures authorising access by a Public Authority, prevent Consider.it from fulfilling its obligations under this DPA. If Consider.it reasonably believes that any existing or future enacted or enforceable laws and practices in the third country of destination applicable to its Processing of the Personal Data ("Local Laws") prevent it from fulfilling its obligations under this DPA, it shall promptly notify Customer. In such a case, Consider.it shall use reasonable efforts to make available to the affected Customer a change in the Services or recommend a commercially reasonable change to Customer's configuration or use of the Services to facilitate compliance with the Local Laws without unreasonably burdening Customer. If Consider.it is unable to make available such change within a reasonable period of time, either party may without penalty, terminate the applicable Order Form(s) with respect only to those Services which cannot be provided by Consider.it in accordance with the Local Laws, by providing written notice to Consider.it. Consider.it will refund Customer any prepaid fees covering the remainder of the term of such Order Form(s) following the effective date of termination with respect to such terminated Services, without imposing a penalty for such termination on Customer.

For the purposes of Table 4 of Part One of the Approved Addendum, neither party may end the Approved Addendum when it changes.
