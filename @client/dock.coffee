# Dock
#
# A component that wraps around another component and enables it
# to stick (dock) to the top of the screen. 
# 
# Only works in browsers that support CSS3 transforms (i.e. IE9+)
#
# This component does: 
#   - Assign the correct position to the element given the scroll 
#     position, desired starting and stopping docking locations,
#     while respecting the stacking order of all other docked 
#     components. 
#   - Use the best positioning method for mobile or desktop
#   - Insert a placeholder of the height of the component when it 
#     docks if necessary, to prevent jerks as the 
#     component is taken out of the normal layout flow
#   - Implement the docking protocol outlined at 
#     http://stackoverflow.com/questions/18358816
#
# This component does NOT yet:
#   - allow for docking to anything but the top
#   - allow you to override default z-index for stacking components
#     which is problematic if you have sticky components that are 
#     designed to overlap. 
#
# You can use this component by:
#
#     Dock
#       key: 'my-dock'
#       ComponentToDoc
#         key: 'my-docked-component'
#
# Props (all optional): 
#
#   key (default = local key)
#     Where docked state & y position is stored.
#
#   docked_key
#     Additional key where docked state should be written. We provide 
#     both key and docked_key because some components change shape when 
#     they become docked, but it becomes performance bottleneck if those
#     components get rerendered every scroll when the y-position stored
#     at key gets updated. 
#
#   start (default = initial y-position of docking element)
#     Can be a 
#       1. Callback that gives the y-position where docking should start. 
#          A callback may be used because docking may be dynamic given a 
#          container that may itself be moving. 
#       2. An offset that will be added to the default start location
#
#   stop (default = Infinity)
#     A callback in the same vein as start, except it should return the 
#     y-position where docking should end. 
#
#   dockable
#     Callback for determining whether this component is eligible for docking. 
#     Useful if there is some other important external state that dictates
#     dockability. 
#
#   constraints (default = [])
#     An array of keys of other docks. These docked components
#     will be treated as a single docked component.
#
#   dock_on_zoomed_screens (default = true)
#     Whether to dock this component if on a zoomed or small screen. 
#
#   skip_jut (default = false)
#     Sometimes you want absolutely positioned children to count toward the
#     top/height calculation of a docking component...sometimes not. This is an 
#     ugly prop and I'd like to solve it more elegantly.
