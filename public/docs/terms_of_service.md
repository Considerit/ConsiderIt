Consider.it Terms of Service
============================

Updated: February 2023

Thanks for using Consider.it! These Terms of Service help us clarify our relationship, in the form of a legal contract between you (the "User" of the Service) and us (Consider.it LLC) when you access a Consider.it forum and/or sign up to use a Consider.it service.

When we say "Consider.it", "Company", "we", or "us" in this document, we mean Consider.it LLC. Consider.it LLC is the company that develops Consider.it, a computer software platform for running Internet deliberation forums. 

We have established the Consider.it website located at [https://consider.it](https://consider.it) and any of its subdomains, which we collectively call the “Site”. Each subdomain of Consider.it is a separate “Forum” that enables you to provide input, feedback and suggestions on the topics described on pages of the Site and contribute to the conversation with other users of the Site, as applicable. 

When we say "Services", we are collectively referring to the Site and the services we provide.

When we say “You” or “your” or "User", we are referring to the people or organizations that own an account with one or more of our Services.

When we say the “Forum Host” or “the Host”, we are referring to the person or persons who created and/or administer a specific Consider.it forum. The Forum Host may or may not represent an organization and, with few exceptions, is not affiliated with us.

We may update these Terms of Service in the future. You can track changes [on GitHub](https://github.com/Considerit/ConsiderIt/tree/master/public/docs). However, our pledge to never sell your data to third parties will remain in place. 

When you use our Services, now or in the future, you are agreeing to the latest Terms of Service. Please read these Terms carefully because they govern your use of the Site and our services. There may be times where we do not exercise or enforce any right or provision of the Terms of Service; in doing so, we are not waiving that right or provision. **These terms do contain a limitation of our liability.**

If you do not agree to this agreement, you should not use our Services. 

Please also take a look at Consider.it’s [Privacy Policy](/docs/legal/privacy_policy). The Privacy Policy explains how we collect and use your information. 

For Forum Hosts, and if applicable, the organization(s) on behalf of whom the forum is hosted, these terms also incorporate the [Consider.it Forum Hosting Terms](/docs/legal/standard_hosting_terms).

Note that the names, look, and feel of the Services are copyright© to the Company. All rights reserved. You must request permission to use the Company's logo or any Service logos for promotional purposes. Please [contact us](https://consider.it/contact) for requests to use logos. We reserve the right to rescind this permission if you violate these Terms of Service.



Security and Privacy
--------------------

1.  Your use of the Services is at your sole risk. 
2.  We reserve the right to temporarily disable your account if your usage significantly exceeds the average usage of other customers of the Services such that your usage is negatively impact the performance of the Service for other customers. This is so rare that it has yet to happen.
3.  We use industry standard practices to protect and secure your data through backups, redundancies, and encryption. We enforce encryption for data transmission from the public Internet. There are some edge cases where we may send your data through our network unencrypted.
4.  You agree that we may process your data as described in our [Privacy Policy](/docs/legal/privacy_policy) and for no other purpose. We as humans can access your data for the following reasons:
    * _To help with support requests you make or a forum host makes._ If you contact us with a support inquiry, we may need to access your account to help resolve a problem. Similarly, if there is a problem at the forum level, in our investigation we may have to access your account.
    * _After fixing a bug that affected you_. Our server can recognize some types of software errors, and automatically notify us when they occur. Sometimes the information included in these automated error reports reveal a bug that, through investigation, we can figure out that it has impacted you. In those rare cases, we may choose to personally (and sheepishly) reach out to you after we fix the problem, so that you can take restorative action. 
    * _To safeguard Consider.it._ We'll look at logs and metadata as part of our work to ensure the security of your data and the Services as a whole. If necessary, we may also access accounts as part of an [abuse investigation](/docs/legal/use_restrictions).
    * _As shared with your forum host_. Consider.it helps the person and/or organization who started the Consider.it forum facilitate a dialogue. Paid versions of Consider.it enable data export of forum data to the forum hosts, including your username and email address.
    * _To the extent required by applicable law._ We only preserve or share customer data if compelled by a US government authority with a legally binding order or proper request under the Stored Communications Act. If a non-US authority approaches us for assistance, our default stance is to refuse unless the order has been approved by the US government, which compels us to comply through procedures outlined in an established mutual legal assistance treaty or agreement mechanism. If we are audited by a tax authority, we only share the bare minimum billing information needed to complete the audit.
5.  We use third party vendors and hosting partners to provide the necessary hardware, software, networking, storage, and related technology required to run the Services. You can see a list of [all our subprocessors](/docs/legal/subprocessors) who handle personal data.
6.  You may request data related to your personal account and service. We have the right to refuse repetitive or technically difficult requests. For information about how we collect and share user information please refer to our [Privacy Policy](/docs/legal/privacy_policy).



Features and Bugs
-----------------

We take pride in the Services we have created, and we love to incorporate into our designs the feedback of users and customers who take the time to give it. But our Service won't match everyone's needs. Consider.it is a tool, and not every project needs a tool of Consider.it's particular shape. We therefore make no guarantee that our Services will meet your specific requirements or expectations.

Furthermore, errors in the software are inevitable, no matter how diligently we test the system before we deploy changes. We do our best to quickly address major bugs (and redress whatever harm we can). We track all bugs reported to us. And we thank you for your understanding.


Termination
-----------

If you wish to terminate your Consider.it account, you can just discontinue using the Services. Or you may [delete your account](/docs/legal/deleting_your_data). All provisions of the Terms which by their nature should survive termination shall survive termination, including, without limitation, ownership provisions, warranty disclaimers, indemnity and limitations of liability.


### Considerit-initiated terminations
We have the right to suspend or terminate your account and refuse any and all current or future use of our Services for any reason at any time. Termination will furthermore result in the deletion of your account or your access to your account, and the forfeiture and relinquishment of all content in your account. If you are an administrator of one or more forums, those forums may also be entirely suspended or deleted. We also reserve the right to refuse the use of the Services to anyone for any reason at any time. We include this clause because of the one in a million account holder who is doing something malicious. In practice, this generally means we will cancel your account without notice if we have evidence that you are using our products to engage in [abusive behavior](/docs/legal/use_restrictions). Verbal, physical, written or other abuse (including threats of abuse or retribution) of Company employee or officer will result in immediate account termination.








Use of site by Governmental Entities
------------------------------------

Consider.it intends to comply with all local, state and federal laws related to the required disclosure of any information provided via the Services. Under some instances the entity sponsoring specific Content or a project (“Host”) through our Services will be a governmental entity. In such instances, the governmental Host may or may not use the information that you provide to the Services for the purposes associated with the Services. It should be noted that such information may or may not be considered public information or public records under applicable state and federal laws. To the extent that anything you contribute to the Services, including your personal information, is considered a public record or as otherwise belonging to a governmental entity and, therefore, subject to certain local, state or federal disclosure laws, such applicable laws will govern the use and required disclosure of such information.





Limitation of Liability
