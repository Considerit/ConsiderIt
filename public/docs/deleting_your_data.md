Accessing, Correcting, or Deleting Your Information
===================================================
Updated: February 2023

You can review and change your personal information by logging into our Services and visiting your user profile page.

If the information you wish to access is not displayed there, you may also send us an email at [hello@consider.it](mailto:hello@consider.it) to request access to, or correct any personal information that you have provided to us. Sometimes we cannot delete your personal information except by also deleting your user account. We may not accommodate a request to change information if we believe the change would violate any law or legal requirement or cause the information to be incorrect.

Deleting content
----------------
<a name="deleting-content"></a>

You can delete Content you've posted to our Services.

In some cases, because you may have created posts that other users have referenced, any Content that may be lawfully retained and displayed will continue to be visible through the Services and retained by us, in an anonymized form. If your posts continue to be visible, they will be entirely anonymized and disassociated with your account.

If you delete your Content from the Services, copies of your Content may remain viewable in cached and archived pages, or might have been copied or stored by other users of the Service. 


Deleting your account
---------------------

You may delete your account by either 
1) Using the account deletion button in your Consider.it profile
2) By emailing a request for deletion to [hello@consider.it](mailto:hello@consider.it). 

When your account is deleted, all content you have posted is also deleted or anonymized, as described above.

**Data canâ€™t be recovered once it has been deleted.**
